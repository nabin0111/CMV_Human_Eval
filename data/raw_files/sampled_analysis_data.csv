I have been inspired by people saying that we should be using the ""Innocent until proven Guilty"", not only in a strictly legal settings, but as a way of life. While this is definitely the most fair, I fail to see how practical it is. Starting off, nearly 100% of our interpersonal decisions are made from links of trust, not proof.

When there is no proof, and the only things left are two personal accounts, I would trust my friend who I would know of their character. Now, I am not saying that my friend is always right, or that it is rational to only trust someone who you personally know.

The bank card is received by mail and the PIN is chosen by the account holder over the phone. * In the UK, you must come in person to the branch and there, present an ID and a proof of address. You later receive the bank card and PIN by mail. * In Switzerland, same as the UK, but you must use a home card reader to access online banking services using your PIN to unlock your account. * In France, same as UK, but you must pick-up the card in person at the bank. A verification by SMS is required for online transactions and bank transfers. * In Czech Republic, same as France, but the PIN is sent by SMS and is encoded.

The more children you have, the more money you get from the government. Screw that, if you can't support yourself you shouldn't be having children, especially if you make me pay for it. NOTE: I am not against welfare, just the way it's implemented. The apartment where I currently live has basically been bribed by the government to rent out tons of its rooms to homeless, and almost every women among them has at least two children at their feet at all times and are pregnant. It is my belief that welfare recipients should receive free birth control and condoms and that they can enter welfare while pregnant and while they have children. However if they become pregnant while on welfare they are either taken off welfare altogether or they must have an abortion. UPDATE: Ok, view changed 30 degrees by Feathering. My modified view is that having kids on welfare won't mean it is revoked from you but it won't raise whatsoever. So every kid will stretch the budget thinner, thus motivation to stop having more children. UPDATE: I am now pro required birth control for anyone on welfare with a 1 strike policy. If they have a child while on welfare and not get it aborted, if they still want welfare they need to voluntarily be TEMPORARILY sterilized(IE a procedure that can be undone after they no longer draw from welfare).

There is no way to be sure patient is committing assisted suicide of their own free will. With 'normal' suicide person's will manifests through physical actions  that they take to kill themselves. If a patient is incapable of performing these physical steps there is no way to be certain they actually mean it. We've all said once in our lives that we want to end it but haven't actually done it. Same logic should apply to terminally ill patients. Even if they say they want to commit suicide, it doesn't mean they would actually do it if they were physically capable. So we shouldn't help them achieve it. In cases where a person is physically capable of committing suicide on their own we should never help them. I don't think it's controversial. But what if a person can only move one finger? They can push a button that delivers lethal overdose but can't do much else. I'd argue even in these cases physicians should not provide patients with means to overdose. Pressing a button is just too easy; it removes natural barriers that prevent us from hurting ourselves. For example, this theoretical patient would press the overdose button but would not hang themselves or otherwise actively kill themselves. Providing a patient with an easy way of killing themselves is intrinsically coercive and coercing people into committing suicide is generally considered bad. *Disclaimer:* There are many good arguments for and against euthanasia.

By Evolution, I refer to the currently taught Darwinian Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection. Based on the authoritative definition of Evolution found in Wikipedia:
Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. The processes by which the changes occur, from one generation to another, are called evolutionary processes or mechanisms. [26] The four most widely recognised evolutionary processes are natural selection, genetic drift, mutation and gene migration due to genetic admixture. [26] Natural selection and genetic drift sort variation; mutation and gene migration create variation. As taught, Evolution is a natural process in which accidental changes produce both positive and negative adaptations in a species. Those that encourage survival remain and reproduce and those that do not die out. As such it is a natural process occurring over long periods of time. Since the advent of human intelligence, humanity has been selectively breeding both itself, the animals it eats and domesticates, and the plants that it harvests and eats. Thus, conducting a form of directed Genetic Engineering through natural processes (a form of GMO). Changes to these human, animal and plant species can thus be thought of in terms of Intelligent Design rather than Evolution. The term Human Controlled Evolution, used by many scientists who should know better, may be inherently correct, but an incorrect usage of terminology.

The idea is that deliberately overeating will build eating habits that will be difficult to change later, when you are working a desk job and being a dad and not burning off those calories. This would not apply to celebrities whose job includes shaping their bodies and people with sufficient self-control that they are never tempted to keep eating the slab of ribs until they're gone. But it happens to former football players all the time. One premise I have that you might not share is that losing weight is just about impossible once you have gained it. There is no scientifically approved diet that you can follow and it will work. This is why any weight gain that disrupts a body with a nice, working non-obese equilibrium is very risky. In sum: like tanning, bulking is something that increases your relative status but is bad for your body in the long run.",966,3,1063.3333333333333,18.876793513023667,1047,1084,Q2,Q3,Q2_Q3
t3_acw4be,"Claiming that 'men are trash' is counter productive to gender equality I am not saying in general men don't commit more crimes. I just think lumping all men together like this is unnecessarily negative and actually holds society back. If you want, read this argument I just had and ignore the terrible grammar: 
What do you think we should reconsider about our views? All I want is to compromise here but not if it means believing in hate speach spread by word of mouth. Does anyone know of any good unbiased articles regarding this matter? Any well thought out opinions would be also helpful. Edit: I have updated some of my comments to give deltas and fully reflect what I know believe. I in no way completely altered what claim I was originally making. It was difficult for me to patronize a seemingly overly negative stance when unbiased points about the matter were not also brought to my attention. This does not mean I do not feel the desire to correct some of the bias opinions I held as well, or may still hold. Making this post has allowed me to better structure my beliefs on the matter in a way that more appropriately sympathizes for woman who still have to fight for equality in many ways. I am very grateful we share the right to express ourselves aggressively as we see fit, yet I will not fully support phrases which insult others for the sake of bringing attention to the matter. It is not an entirely counter productive way of creating change but I still see it as a flawed method which can easily divide people when the true goal is the opposite.",1566,3,1499.3333333333333,135.69205331681488,1396,1653,Q4,Q4,Q4_Q4
t3_28sivx,"I see no reason why men's and women's chess are separate events. Sure, sex segregation makes a lot of sense for many sports/games where men might have an advantage due to physiological differences. But chess is purely mental. There is no need for strength, speed, endurance or any other physiological parameter that would give men an advantage. In fact, some women do compete successfully in top flight tournaments with men, something that would be impossible in physical sports. If anything, it seems that ""women only"" chess events are sexist, because the implication is that women are not as smart as men. Edit:
The totality of several posts convinced me that women only events maybe needed *for now* as a kind of a remedial measure for countering many years of men dominance in chess and the fact that currently women are underrepresented in chess. However, I still believe that an *eventual* goal should be complete sex equality in chess tournaments.",954,3,879.3333333333334,120.3841074782437,743,971,Q2,Q1,Q2_Q1
