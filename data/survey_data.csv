t3_pddibd,"Debates are better online because you cant interrupt someones written post A person puts up a table and a sign that says Pro Life, change my view. As more people join the conversation, members of the crowd yell sexist pig, my body my rights, and generally get more aggressive with their heckling. The point of the debate was to truly change a persons mind, but it has now devolved into near physical altercation because two sides cant agree to let the other side finish their sentences. This scene of debates goes back as old as ancient Greece all the way to modern democratic parliaments. Humans are simply too emotional to put them aside for the sake of truth seeking. Angers rise when words can no longer be found. Edit: Thanks guys. What I like about this thread is that it both proved and disproved my argument. I learned a lot via online opinions but I also learned that online makes debates very disjointed and lose interest.","The argument that debates are better online because they allow for uninterrupted expression of opinions overlooks the nuances of human communication. In face-to-face interactions, emotional responses can indeed be intense, but this does not preclude meaningful exchange and understanding. The example provided, where a person is heckled in public, may illustrate the difficulties of live debate, but it also highlights the importance of respectful engagement and active listening. By contrast, online debates often devolve into echo chambers, where individuals congregate with like-minded others and engage in confirmation bias rather than genuinely seeking to change their views. Furthermore, the anonymity afforded by online platforms can embolden aggressive behavior, making it more challenging for participants to moderate their tone. To argue that online debates are inherently superior because they eliminate interruption overlooks these potential pitfalls. Moreover, research has shown that face-to-face interactions facilitate deeper empathy and understanding, as participants can pick up on nonverbal cues and respond accordingly. These factors suggest that the value of uninterrupted expression in online debates may be overstated. Additionally, it is worth noting that many successful debating formats, such as Oxford-style debates, rely heavily on verbal sparring and interruption to engage audiences and challenge assumptions.","The argument that online debates are inherently superior because they allow for uninterrupted expression neglects the importance of context and situational awareness in human communication. In face-to-face interactions, participants can pick up on subtle cues such as body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions, which provide valuable information about the speaker's intentions and emotional state. By contrast, online debates often lack these contextual clues, making it more challenging for participants to accurately interpret each other's words. Moreover, the written word can be prone to misinterpretation, as the tone and intent behind a message may not be immediately clear. This highlights the need for effective communication strategies that take into account the limitations of online interaction. Rather than relying solely on uninterrupted expression, online debates might benefit from incorporating additional features such as video conferencing, live polling, or anonymous feedback mechanisms to facilitate more nuanced and empathetic engagement. By acknowledging the complexities of human communication and adapting our approaches accordingly, we can create online debating environments that are more inclusive, engaging, and effective than those of their face-to-face counterparts.","The notion that humans are inherently too emotional to engage in rational debate overlooks the numerous instances where individuals have successfully navigated complex discussions without succumbing to anger or aggression. In fact, many online forums and social media platforms have implemented moderation tools and community guidelines to promote respectful dialogue. By acknowledging the potential for disagreement and implementing strategies to manage conflict, it is possible to create environments that facilitate meaningful exchange and learning. Furthermore, the example of ancient Greece, often cited as evidence of the futility of live debate, can also be seen as a testament to the power of human reason and critical thinking in the face of adversity. The Greeks did not shy away from heated debates; instead, they harnessed their passions and intellects to engage in some of the most influential and enduring philosophical discussions in history. Rather than assuming that humans are too emotional for rational debate, it is more productive to focus on developing skills and strategies for effective communication and conflict resolution.","The idea that humans are inherently too emotional to engage in constructive debate is a notion that has been challenged throughout history. In fact, some of the most pivotal moments of civil discourse have occurred in the midst of intense emotional debate. The abolition of slavery in the 19th century, for instance, was sparked by passionate arguments from abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and William Wilberforce. These individuals, far from being silenced or drowned out by opposing views, were able to effectively communicate their message through impassioned oratory and persuasive writing. Similarly, the women's suffrage movement of the early 20th century was fueled by the tireless efforts of activists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, who faced down opposition and ridicule with courage and conviction.

While it is true that online debates can sometimes devolve into chaos, this is not necessarily a reflection of human nature, but rather a function of the medium itself. Online platforms can lack the nuances of face-to-face interaction, making it difficult to gauge the tone and intent behind a particular message. However, this does not mean that online debates are inherently inferior or that they cannot be used as a tool for education and critical thinking. In fact, online debates can provide a unique opportunity for individuals to engage with diverse perspectives and engage in thoughtful, reflective discussion. Moreover, the ability to revisit and reflect on previous arguments can be a valuable learning experience, allowing individuals to refine their thinking and develop more nuanced understandings of complex issues.

Furthermore, online debates can also provide a platform for marginalized voices to be heard. Historically, individuals from minority groups have often been silenced or excluded from public discourse, but online platforms can level the playing field and provide a space for these voices to be heard. This can lead to a more inclusive and diverse range of perspectives, enriching the debate and promoting a more nuanced understanding of the issues at hand. While it is true that online debates are not without their challenges, they offer a unique opportunity for critical thinking and education that should not be dismissed out of hand. By embracing the potential of online debates, we can foster a culture of critical thinking and civility, where individuals are encouraged to engage with diverse perspectives and develop a deeper understanding of the world around them.","While it is true that in-person debates can sometimes devolve into unproductive exchanges, this does not necessarily mean that they are inherently flawed. In fact, when conducted with civility and respect, debates can be a powerful tool for refining one's understanding of complex issues. By engaging with opponents in a structured and respectful manner, debaters can tease out nuances and subtleties that might be overlooked in online discussions, where the absence of nonverbal cues can lead to misinterpretation and misunderstanding. For example, in the study of moth species, researchers often rely on precise observations of behavior and anatomy to classify and understand their relationships. Similarly, in debates, a well-structured exchange can allow participants to observe and analyze each other's reasoning, leading to a more nuanced understanding of the issues at hand.

Moreover, the structured environment of in-person debates can actually promote a more thoughtful and considered approach to argumentation, as participants are less likely to be swayed by emotional appeals or fallacies. This is particularly relevant in fields such as scientific inquiry, where the careful consideration of opposing viewpoints is essential for advancing knowledge and understanding. In contrast, online debates often suffer from the ""echo chamber"" effect, where participants are more likely to engage with like-minded individuals and avoid confronting opposing views. By engaging in face-to-face debates, participants can gain a more well-rounded understanding of the issues and be more likely to engage with opposing viewpoints in a constructive and respectful manner.

Furthermore, debates are not necessarily about ""winning"" or ""losing,"" but rather about engaging in a process of discovery and critical thinking. By approaching debates as a collaborative effort to explore complex ideas, rather than a competitive exercise in one-upmanship, participants can gain a deeper understanding of the issues and develop a more nuanced appreciation for the perspectives of others. In fact, many of the greatest scientific breakthroughs have been the result of debates and discussions between individuals with differing perspectives, who were able to engage in a respectful and constructive exchange of ideas. Ultimately, by valuing civility, respect, and structured argumentation, in-person debates can be a powerful tool for fostering a deeper understanding of complex issues and promoting a more nuanced appreciation for the perspectives of others.","While it's true that traditional debates can sometimes devolve into heated and aggressive exchanges, this shouldn't be taken as representative of all face-to-face debates. In fact, many academic and intellectual institutions have developed structured debate formats that emphasize respectful dialogue and critical thinking. For instance, the Socratic Method, used in some law schools and philosophy programs, encourages participants to engage in a respectful and constructive exchange of ideas. This approach prioritizes understanding and learning over winning or dominating the argument.

Moreover, face-to-face debates offer opportunities for nonverbal cues and body language, which are essential for building empathy and understanding. When participants can see and respond to each other's facial expressions and tone of voice, they are more likely to engage in a genuinely constructive dialogue. This type of communication can help to break down barriers and foster a sense of community, essential for navigating complex social issues. Furthermore, in-person debates can be structured to include breakout sessions, small group discussions, and other interactive elements that promote active listening and collaboration.

In addition, online debates often suffer from the limitations of text-based communication, which can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations. Without the ability to hear tone, pitch, and nuance, online participants may be more likely to misread or misinterpret each other's intentions, leading to conflict and polarization. In contrast, in-person debates can help to mitigate these issues by providing a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of each other's perspectives. By fostering a culture of respectful dialogue and active listening, educators can help students develop the skills they need to engage with complex social issues in a constructive and empathetic manner."
t3_6kov77,"Human Evolution has Ceased My contention is that Human Evolution has ceased, or has significantly slowed, since the advent of human intelligence. By Evolution, I refer to the currently taught Darwinian Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection. Based on the authoritative definition of Evolution found in Wikipedia:
Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. The processes by which the changes occur, from one generation to another, are called evolutionary processes or mechanisms. 26 The four most widely recognised evolutionary processes are natural selection, genetic drift, mutation and gene migration due to genetic admixture. 26 Natural selection and genetic drift sort variation; mutation and gene migration create variation. As taught, Evolution is a natural process in which accidental changes produce both positive and negative adaptations in a species. Those that encourage survival remain and reproduce and those that do not die out. As such it is a natural process occurring over long periods of time. Since the advent of human intelligence, humanity has been selectively breeding both itself, the animals it eats and domesticates, and the plants that it harvests and eats. Thus, conducting a form of directed Genetic Engineering through natural processes (a form of GMO). Changes to these human, animal and plant species can thus be thought of in terms of Intelligent Design rather than Evolution. The term Human Controlled Evolution, used by many scientists who should know better, may be inherently correct, but an incorrect usage of terminology. Change my view.  the CMV moderators.","The notion that human evolution has ceased or significantly slowed due to the advent of human intelligence relies on a simplistic understanding of the complex processes driving evolutionary change. While it is true that humans have selectively bred certain characteristics in domesticated species, this does not negate the fact that natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, and gene migration continue to shape the human genome. In fact, the human genome is replete with examples of genetic variation resulting from these mechanisms, including genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications, and gene expression changes that occur independently of human control. Moreover, the concept of intelligent design oversimplifies the intricate relationships between genetic and environmental factors that contribute to evolutionary change. Furthermore, the idea that humans can control the evolution of species through directed genetic engineering ignores the fact that many genetic changes can have unforeseen consequences, as seen in the unintended effects of gene editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9. In the context of cancer research, for example, our attempts to harness genetic engineering to develop targeted therapies have led to the emergence of resistance mechanisms that can compromise treatment efficacy. Similarly, the unintended consequences of genetic engineering in humans and other species may be more profound and far-reaching than currently anticipated. The notion that human evolution has ceased or slowed down also ignores the fact that humans are still subject to environmental pressures and natural selection, such as changes in diet, lifestyle, and exposure to pathogens, which continue to influence the evolution of the human genome. In addition, the concept of Human Controlled Evolution implies a level of control that is currently not possible with our current understanding of genetics and genomics. Our understanding of the human genome is incomplete, and the complexity of gene-environment interactions is still not fully grasped. Until we have a more comprehensive understanding of these interactions, it is premature to conclude that human evolution has ceased or slowed down.","The notion that human evolution has ceased or significantly slowed since the advent of human intelligence is an oversimplification of the complex interplay between natural and human-driven forces that shape the evolution of our species. The fact that humans have selectively bred animals and plants for desirable traits does not negate the fundamental principles of evolution. Instead, it highlights the dynamic and adaptive nature of evolutionary processes, where species can respond to changing environments and pressures, including those imposed by human activity. The term ""Human Controlled Evolution"" may be a convenient label, but it fails to capture the intricacies of the evolutionary process.

Consider the example of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These organisms have evolved through a process of natural selection, driven by the selective pressure imposed by human use of antibiotics. While humans have inadvertently accelerated the evolution of these resistant strains, the underlying mechanism of natural selection remains the driving force. Similarly, the genetic changes that occur in domesticated animals, such as dogs or cattle, are a result of both natural and artificial selection, with humans providing the selective pressure through breeding and artificial selection. The distinction between natural and artificial selection is not as clear-cut as your argument suggests, and the two processes interact in complex ways that cannot be reduced to a simple label like ""Intelligent Design.""

Furthermore, the idea that humans are no longer subject to the forces of evolution is a misconception. Our species continues to evolve, albeit at a potentially slower rate than in the past, due to the fact that we have largely escaped the pressures of natural selection. However, the impact of human activity on our environment and our own biology is an ongoing process that will continue to drive evolutionary change. For instance, the rise of genetic diseases, such as antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis, is a direct result of human activity and has led to the emergence of new strains that are more virulent and resistant to treatment. This example illustrates the ongoing role of evolution in shaping our species, even in the face of human intervention.

Ultimately, the concept of ""Human Controlled Evolution"" is a misnomer that fails to capture the complexity of the evolutionary process. It is not a replacement for the fundamental principles of evolution, but rather an additional layer of complexity that highlights the intricate interplay between natural and human-driven forces. By recognizing and embracing this complexity, we can gain a deeper understanding of the evolutionary process and its ongoing role in shaping our species.","While it is true that humans have selectively bred many species, often with significant success, this does not necessarily mean that evolution has ceased. The argument that human-controlled evolution is equivalent to intelligent design is an oversimplification of the complex and multifaceted nature of evolutionary processes. The timescales involved in evolution are vast, spanning millions of years, and human intervention is but a fleeting moment in this grand timeline. Even with the most concerted efforts to control or direct evolution, humans are limited by their own cognitive biases and the inherent unpredictability of natural systems.

Furthermore, genetic drift, mutation, and other evolutionary processes continue to shape the human genome, often in ways that are not immediately apparent or even desirable. For example, the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which arises through the process of genetic drift, is a prime example of an evolutionary adaptation that occurs despite our best efforts to control it. Similarly, the evolution of genetic disorders, such as sickle cell anemia, demonstrates that even our most well-intentioned efforts to manipulate the human genome can have unintended consequences.

Moreover, humans are not the only species that have selectively bred certain traits in their populations. Many other species, such as plants and animals, have also undergone artificial selection through human intervention, yet this does not mean that evolution has ceased in these species. In fact, the process of artificial selection can often accelerate evolutionary changes, leading to the development of new species or subspecies. This is a clear demonstration that evolution is an ongoing process that cannot be halted or controlled by human action.

The term ""human-controlled evolution"" may be a useful concept for understanding the impact of human activity on the natural world, but it is a misnomer to imply that this represents a form of intelligent design. Evolution is a complex and multifaceted process that involves a multitude of factors and mechanisms, and to reduce it to a simple label such as ""human-controlled evolution"" does a disservice to the rich history and diversity of evolutionary theory. By recognizing the ongoing and uncontrollable nature of evolution, we can better appreciate the intricate web of relationships between humans and the natural world, and work towards a more nuanced understanding of our place within the grand tapestry of life on Earth.","The argument that human evolution has ceased relies heavily on a misconception about the role of natural selection in shaping the human genome. While it is true that humans have selectively bred many species, this process has not eliminated the need for adaptation to changing environments or the presence of deleterious mutations. In fact, recent studies have shown that many genetic variants associated with complex diseases are still present in modern human populations, despite efforts at selective breeding. This suggests that evolution continues to operate on a larger timescale, shaping the human genome in response to subtle changes in environmental pressures. Moreover, the concept of ""intelligent design"" ignores the many instances where human activities have inadvertently driven evolutionary change, such as the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria or the adaptation of pests to pesticides. These examples demonstrate that evolution is an ongoing process that can be shaped by a variety of factors, including human actions. By downplaying the significance of these dynamics, the original argument overlooks the intricate and nuanced nature of evolutionary processes.","The assertion that human evolution has ceased or significantly slowed since the advent of human intelligence relies heavily on a narrow interpretation of the Darwinian Theory of Evolution. However, this perspective overlooks the complex and multifaceted nature of evolutionary processes. Human intelligence has indeed enabled the manipulation of genetic variation through artificial selection, but it has not eliminated the underlying mechanisms of evolution. In fact, human activities such as selective breeding have accelerated the rate of evolutionary change in certain species, demonstrating that evolution can occur rapidly in response to changing environments or selective pressures. Moreover, the concept of ""intelligent design"" is problematic because it implies a directed and intentional process, whereas evolution is fundamentally an undirected and stochastic phenomenon. The idea of human-controlled evolution, while potentially accurate from a descriptive perspective, does not challenge the core principles of evolutionary theory. Instead, it highlights the capacity for humans to shape their own evolution through technological means. Furthermore, there are numerous examples of human-induced evolutionary changes that defy simplistic notions of intelligent design, such as the adaptation of bacteria to antibiotics or the emergence of pesticide-resistant pests. These observations underscore the ongoing and dynamic nature of evolution in response to changing environmental pressures.","The contention that human evolution has ceased or slowed since the advent of human intelligence relies on a flawed assumption about the relationship between technological advancements and biological change. While it is true that humans have developed technologies to shape their environment and manipulate genetic variation, this does not mean that evolution has ceased to operate in other domains. In fact, recent studies have shown that many non-human species continue to evolve at rapid rates in response to changing environmental pressures, such as climate change or habitat fragmentation. These observations suggest that the drivers of evolutionary change are more complex and multifaceted than previously thought, involving interactions between humans, non-human animals, and their environments. By ignoring these dynamics, the original argument oversimplifies the nature of evolution and underestimates its capacity for ongoing change in response to changing circumstances."
t3_rht8jf,"It is not better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. A famous quote by Alfred Lord Tennyson goes: 'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. I disagree. As someone who has loved and lost someone to death, I can say that the pain of the loss is absolutely horrible. It seems to me if you have never loved, you would not know the pain and loneliness such loss brings. The emptiness and despair I felt after burying my wife of thirty four years was indescribable. And now, even though I was blessed enough to find love a second time in my advancing years simply highlights the emptiness I felt when I was alone. I have seen many cases of people who die a short time after the loss of their spouse. Some commit suicide, others, like my father, seem to simply wither away in despair. I was lucky after my wife died, I found a good woman who was as hungry for love as myself. I am happy now. But to many people the loss of a true love is a pain that never ends. So tell me I'm wrong, you can't miss something you never had.","Love and loss may be a painful experience, but it is precisely this pain that can ignite the spark of creativity, inspiring stories that touch the hearts of people across the world. Consider the iconic works of literature that have been born from the ashes of love and loss, such as Shakespeare's tragic romances or the classic novels of Jane Austen. These authors didn't shy away from exploring the depths of human emotion, and their stories continue to captivate audiences to this day. In fact, the human experience of love and loss is what makes us relatable and endearing to one another, creating a shared understanding that transcends words.

Moreover, the transformative power of love and loss can be a double-edged sword. While it can indeed bring immense pain, it also has the capacity to shape us into more compassionate, empathetic, and creative individuals. By embracing this duality, writers can craft narratives that not only capture the pain of love and loss but also the beauty, the joy, and the growth that can arise from it. Think of the countless characters in literature who have been shaped by their experiences of love and loss, only to emerge stronger, wiser, and more resilient as a result. Their stories serve as beacons of hope, reminding us that even in the darkest moments, there is always the possibility for transformation and renewal.

In the end, the notion that it is better never to have loved at all is a bleak and narrow perspective that neglects the complexities of human experience. By embracing the pain of love and loss, we can tap into a rich source of inspiration, creating stories that not only reflect the world we live in but also help us make sense of it. The idea that we should avoid love altogether is a form of self-imposed exile, one that robs us of the opportunity to experience the full spectrum of human emotions and to connect with others on a deep level. In contrast, by embracing love and loss, we can find the courage to tell the stories that need to be told, stories that will resonate with audiences for generations to come.","While it is true that the loss of a loved one can be a devastating experience, it is also true that it can be a catalyst for growth and renewal. Just as the cycles of life and death are an integral part of the natural world, so too are they a natural part of human experience. The process of metamorphosis, which we see in moths and butterflies, can be seen as a powerful metaphor for the way that love and loss can transform us. In this process, the individual is not destroyed, but rather, it is reborn into something new, just as a caterpillar transforms into a beautiful butterfly.

Furthermore, the idea that one can never truly know the pain of loss if they have never loved is a romantic notion, but not necessarily true. While it is true that those who have not experienced loss may not understand the depth of the pain, they can still empathize with those who have. In fact, the act of loving and losing someone can be a profound way to understand and appreciate the value of human connection, even if it is fleeting. The transformative power of love can be seen in the way that it can bring people together, creating a sense of community and shared experience that transcends individual loss.

In many species, including some moths and butterflies, the loss of a mate can actually stimulate the individual to produce new offspring, ensuring the continuation of the species. Similarly, the loss of a loved one can inspire us to find new meaning and purpose in life, to create and nurture new relationships, and to pass on the lessons we have learned to others. This is not a rejection of the pain of loss, but rather an acknowledgment of its value as a catalyst for growth and renewal. By embracing this perspective, we can find a way to honor the memory of those we have lost, while also celebrating the beauty and resilience of the human spirit.","While it's true that the loss of a loved one can be a profound experience, one that leaves an indelible mark on the heart, it's also true that the absence of love can be just as transformative. Consider the way a blank canvas can evoke feelings of possibility and potential, waiting to be filled with color and texture. It's possible that those who have never loved may be more open to experiencing life in its entirety, without the preconceptions and expectations that come with knowing what it means to love and lose. They may approach life with a sense of wonder and curiosity, unencumbered by the weight of past experiences. Moreover, the human experience is not solely defined by love and loss, but also by joy, friendship, and a deep connection with nature and the world around us. The absence of love can be a void that can be filled by other meaningful relationships and experiences, such as the beauty of a sunrise, the companionship of a pet, or the sense of belonging to a community. In fact, many people who have never loved may be more resilient in the face of adversity, having never experienced the vulnerability that comes with loving and losing. This does not diminish the importance of love, but rather highlights the complexity and multiplicity of human experience. The idea that one must experience love and loss to truly appreciate life is a romantic notion, but it's not necessarily a universal truth. Ultimately, the value of life lies not in the experiences we have, but in how we choose to respond to them, and it's possible to find meaning and purpose without the burden of past love and loss. By embracing the unknown, we may find that we're more open to the possibilities and opportunities that life has to offer.","The argument that it is not better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all overlooks the fact that loss and grief are not mutually exclusive with continued life and happiness. Many people who have experienced profound loss go on to find joy, contentment, and even love again. This capacity for resilience and adaptation is a testament to the human spirit's ability to cope with adversity. Furthermore, it is possible to love and lose without being defined solely by that experience. Love can be a source of strength, comfort, and inspiration, even in the midst of sorrow. The notion that one cannot move forward from loss is overly simplistic and does not acknowledge the complexities of human emotion and relationships.","The assertion that it is not better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all presumes a static understanding of happiness and fulfillment, one where the absence of love is equivalent to a state of bliss. However, this stance ignores the fact that people are multifaceted beings with diverse needs, desires, and aspirations. Love can be a vital component of human experience, bringing depth, richness, and meaning to life. While it is true that loss can be devastating, it can also serve as a reminder of what has been gained through love and relationships. The idea that one cannot appreciate the value of love without experiencing its loss overlooks the many ways in which love can enrich our lives, even when it does not last forever.","The idea that it is not better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all assumes a singular perspective on the human experience, one where love is an end in itself. However, this stance neglects the complexities of emotional growth and development that come from experiencing loss. While it is true that the pain of losing a loved one can be overwhelming, it also has the potential to foster resilience, empathy, and a deeper understanding of oneself and others. Moreover, the void left by such a loss can create opportunities for personal transformation and self-discovery. For instance, individuals who have navigated the aftermath of bereavement often emerge with a renewed sense of purpose and a more profound appreciation for life. The notion that one cannot miss something they never had fails to account for the ways in which love can be a catalyst for positive change, even in the face of adversity."
t3_xaj11z,"Good friendships and romantic relationships will inevitably burn out like a candle This view is making me sad. Since recently I have a friend who I'm really close with, first time in my life that I'm so close with someone. She has given me something I never had. Warmth, affection, someone laughing at my stupid jokes, someone actually giving a shit about me. And then ofc my stupid brain must find some way to make it seem bad. Well it chose to go with 
 ""you will lose her eventually because the lifespan of a friendship is limited. Yes you will perhaps remain friends after this lifespan but it won't be on the same level as it used to be, it will become boring, you will care less about them than now, you care now because it is new to you and because you want to discover them, learn about them, but eventually that will be over. Eventually you will know basically everything about them, you'll have asked every question you'll know every story and you'll be able to predict their answers before they even say it, and that will annoy you, because that will make things boring with them. Sure there are other things to talk about, maybe politics or exchange ideas, that's cool but not on the same level. You used to have friends to talk to about ideas, that was fun, but in no way was it a close friendship. The moment they disappeared they were not forgotten but there was no real longing to see them either."" So now whenever we text and have a convo going it's a mixed feeling because one side really likes the talking with them but then another voice is whispering that by talking to them it brings me one step closer to knowing all about them and being closer to the 'boring phase', just like a bright candle burns faster than a dim candle I suppose. I strongly wish to cmv...","The candle analogy, while vivid, misrepresents the complex nature of human relationships. A more accurate comparison might be a flame that adapts and adjusts to its surroundings, rather than simply burning out. Relationships require effort and commitment from all parties involved, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it can foster growth, understanding, and a deeper appreciation for one another's quirks and strengths. Rather than focusing on the potential drawbacks of familiarity, consider the countless examples of people who have built lasting relationships that are richer and more meaningful precisely because they have had time to develop and evolve together. The key is not to fear getting to know someone too well, but to approach the process with an open mind and a willingness to adapt and learn from each other over time.","The limited lifespan argument often cited as proof of this phenomenon is based on an oversimplification of human connection. It assumes that familiarity breeds contempt, and that once a person has learned everything about someone else, they will become bored and disinterested. However, this overlooks the importance of intimacy in relationships. Studies have shown that people value emotional closeness and feeling understood by their partner or friend above other aspects of their relationship. In fact, research on attachment theory suggests that individuals tend to form close bonds with those who are consistent and reliable sources of comfort, support, and security. As long as these core needs continue to be met, relationships can persist even when novelty wears off.","The notion that good friendships and romantic relationships are destined to burn out like a candle is rooted in a pessimistic view of human connection. This perspective disregards the numerous examples of long-lasting, fulfilling relationships where individuals continue to grow and deepen their bond over time. Research has shown that people who have a strong social support network tend to experience better mental and physical health outcomes, which suggests that meaningful relationships are not inherently fleeting. Furthermore, many couples and friends report experiencing a renewed sense of excitement and connection in their relationships as they navigate new stages of life together, such as starting a family or pursuing common interests. It is possible for relationships to evolve and adapt over time, incorporating new aspects and dimensions that keep the dynamic fresh and engaging.","Relationships are not like properties that depreciate in value over time, but rather investments that appreciate in value when properly maintained. While it's true that friendships may evolve and change over time, they do not necessarily decline in a linear fashion. In fact, the very aspects of a friendship that may seem mundane or predictable to you now are often the foundation upon which deeper, more meaningful connections are built. Think of it this way: a well-maintained relationship is like a property that has been renovated and updated, its value increasing with each passing year as the memories and experiences shared between friends continue to accumulate. The fact that you know your friend's jokes and can predict their answers is not a sign of boredom, but rather a testament to the strength of your bond. It's precisely this kind of familiarity that allows for more in-depth, nuanced conversations, which can be just as fulfilling as the initial excitement of getting to know someone new. Furthermore, relationships are not static entities that exist independently of external factors; they are dynamic systems influenced by the people involved, their experiences, and their choices. By focusing on the present moment and nurturing your friendship, you can create a sense of continuity and growth, even as the relationship evolves. In fact, it's often the relationships that have endured over time that are the most valuable, precisely because they have been tested and proven resilient. Rather than viewing your friendship as a finite resource that will eventually burn out, consider it a dynamic ecosystem that requires care and attention to thrive. By shifting your perspective in this way, you can begin to see the potential for growth and development in your relationship, rather than its inevitable decline.","The notion that friendships and romantic relationships inevitably ""burn out"" like a candle may be a limiting and overly pessimistic view. Research in attachment theory suggests that secure attachment styles, characterized by emotional openness and vulnerability, are often associated with more satisfying and enduring relationships. In fact, the very qualities that make relationships exciting and novel at the beginning  such as the discovery of new interests, shared experiences, and emotional intimacy  are also the foundation for deepening and sustaining connections over time. Rather than viewing this process as a decline into boredom, it's possible to see it as a natural progression towards a more profound and meaningful connection.

Consider the example of couples who have been together for decades. They may have long since exhausted the initial excitement of new love, but their relationships are often characterized by a deep sense of comfort, trust, and emotional intelligence. They have developed a nuanced understanding of each other's thoughts, feelings, and needs, which allows them to navigate conflicts and challenges with ease. This is not a sign of boredom, but rather a testament to the depth of their emotional connection. Similarly, close friendships can continue to evolve and deepen over time, even as the initial excitement and novelty wear off.

Moreover, the idea that relationships must be constantly exciting and novel in order to be fulfilling is a unrealistic and unhealthy expectation. Human connection is not a spectator sport; it's a dynamic and evolving process that requires effort, commitment, and emotional intelligence to navigate its ups and downs. By embracing the complexities and imperfections of relationships, we can cultivate a more realistic and optimistic view of their potential for growth and intimacy. Rather than viewing relationships as candles that inevitably burn out, we can see them as dynamic systems that require attention, care, and nurturing to flourish over time.","The notion that friendships and romantic relationships inevitably burn out like a candle is a narrative perpetuated by a culture that values novelty and disposability. This cultural emphasis on the ""new and exciting"" leads individuals to measure relationships by their initial intensity and novelty, rather than their enduring quality and depth. In reality, meaningful relationships can evolve and grow over time, taking on new forms and dimensions that are just as valuable as the initial stages. The idea that relationships must be constantly ""new"" and ""exciting"" to be fulfilling is a myth that neglects the complexity and richness of human connections. Furthermore, this narrative overlooks the many examples of long-lasting and fulfilling relationships that have stood the test of time, where the partners have grown and learned together, adapting to each other's changes and evolution.

Moreover, the concept of the ""boring phase"" is a narrow and limiting view of what relationships can offer. While it is true that the initial stages of a relationship can be marked by a sense of discovery and excitement, it is precisely this initial stage that sets the foundation for deeper connections and understanding. As relationships mature, they can take on a richness and depth that goes beyond the superficial level of conversation and novelty-seeking. By valuing the ""boring phase"" as a natural and necessary part of relationship development, individuals can begin to see the beauty in the everyday moments and rituals that bring people together.

In addition, the idea that relationships are inherently fleeting and impermanent is a narrative that can be attributed to societal pressures and expectations, rather than any inherent truth about human connections. This narrative can lead individuals to prioritize short-term gains and instant gratification, rather than investing in the long-term growth and development of relationships. By challenging this narrative and embracing a more nuanced understanding of relationships, individuals can begin to see the value in investing time and effort into building lasting connections with others. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to redefine what they value and prioritize in their relationships, moving beyond the cultural narratives that prioritize novelty and disposability."
t3_98k1to,"Humanity is a disease and despite the hopes of religions, philosophies, ways of living etc. We aren't gonna get any better. Colour this to my mental health, view of self, onset of nihilism or just general pessimistic view on life but the more I'm learning about the world, people and society in general the more I can't stand it. Now I know there's gonna be some comedic geniuses that will say ""you sound like a university fresher who's just found Schopenhauer""""fuck off newfag"" but I'm genuinely struggling to see it. There are pockets of beauty within humanity I don't doubt that for a second, nature and wildlife are breathtaking. But the fact they are so few and far between in the grand scheme of fuckery that is going on astounds me how we're all keeping it together and not going all out anarchy. FMG, Slavery (actual and the prison industrial complex), ethnic cleansing, labour camps, corruption, sexual abuse, all our ""heroes"" being utter scumbags, a burgeoning mental health crisis throughout the world, organ harvesting, people still believing in 2000 year old myths and using them for whatever fucked up agenda they have (yes I do realise religion can be a force for good, get outta here ratheism), deeply flawed political systems, social media, celebrities who have not a lick of merit or usefulness in the world other than to generate paper with ""important people on them"". Lord God I could go on for years. Someone please give me a coherent reason as to why we self-aware apes shouldn't follow ol' Rust Cohle's advice and walk into a collective oblivion gracefully. Other than our inherent biological drive for survival and self-preservation why are we persisting to breed? Someone for the love of Jah change my infantile, ungrateful view.","Beauty can be found in the darkest corners of human existence, and it's precisely this darkness that can spark the creativity and innovation needed to drive change. Take, for instance, the works of artists who have been influenced by the struggles of human suffering, such as Picasso's Guernica or Frida Kahlo's self-portraits. These masterpieces are not just a reflection of their own pain but a testament to the human capacity to transform adversity into something transcendent. Similarly, the pockets of beauty within humanity, as the author acknowledges, are not mere exceptions but rather a testament to the boundless potential that lies within every individual.

The fashion industry, for example, has the power to inspire change through sustainable and responsible practices that not only minimize environmental impact but also promote inclusivity and social justice. Designers can create clothing lines that not only reflect the beauty of nature but also support causes that uplift marginalized communities. The intersection of art and fashion can be a powerful tool for social commentary, raising awareness about pressing issues and inspiring collective action.

Moreover, childhood memories are not just nostalgic reminders of a simpler time but a reminder of the inherent goodness that exists within human beings. They represent a time when empathy, kindness, and compassion were not yet tainted by the complexities of adulthood. By drawing inspiration from these memories, designers can create pieces that evoke a sense of wonder, curiosity, and hope. This, in turn, can inspire individuals to re-examine their own values and become more engaged in creating positive change.

Furthermore, the notion that humanity is inherently flawed and that we should simply accept our fate is a perspective that can be both limiting and damaging. It can lead to a sense of powerlessness, which can exacerbate the very problems we seek to solve. Instead, by embracing our capacity for growth and transformation, we can work together to create a brighter future. By acknowledging the beauty and potential within ourselves and others, we can foster a culture of empathy, cooperation, and mutual support. This, in turn, can lead to a more just and equitable society, where every individual has the opportunity to thrive.","The notion that humanity is a disease, a notion that's been perpetuated by the likes of Schopenhauer, may seem appealing in its bleakness, but it's a reductionist view that fails to account for the complexities of the human experience. Human existence is not solely defined by its flaws, but by the intricate web of relationships, stories, and experiences that make up the fabric of our lives. It's the intricate dance of human connections that gives rise to moments of beauty, kindness, and hope, even in the darkest of times. Consider the countless acts of altruism, the countless acts of courage, and the countless moments of kindness that occur every day, often going unnoticed by the cynic's gaze.

The fact that there are pockets of beauty within humanity, as you acknowledge, is not a reason to dismiss the entire species. Rather, it's a testament to the resilience and capacity for growth that exists within us. The fact that we're able to find meaning and purpose in our lives, despite the overwhelming evidence of societal flaws, speaks to the inherent value of human experience. It's this capacity for self-awareness, for introspection, and for growth that sets us apart from other species, and it's this capacity that allows us to learn from our mistakes and strive for a better world.

Moreover, your notion that humanity's flaws are inherent and ineradicable is not supported by the facts. While it's true that we've committed atrocities throughout history, we've also made tremendous progress in terms of human rights, equality, and social justice. The fact that we're still struggling to overcome these issues is not a reason to give up, but rather a call to action. We're not just self-aware apes; we're a species capable of change, capable of growth, and capable of striving for a better future.

Your question about why we persist to breed, despite our flaws, is a valid one. But the answer lies not in our inherent biological drive, but in our capacity for hope, for love, and for connection. We breed because we're driven by a desire to create, to nurture, and to love. We breed because we're capable of experiencing the world in all its beauty and complexity, and we want to share that experience with others. We breed because we're driven by a deep-seated desire to leave a mark on the world, to make a difference, and to leave a legacy that outlasts us.

In the end, it's not about walking into a collective oblivion, as Rust Cohle would have us do. It's about embracing the complexities of human existence, with all its flaws and all its beauty. It's about finding ways to grow, to learn, and to evolve as a species. It's about embracing our capacity for hope, for love, and for connection, and using that capacity to create a better world for all.","The notion that humanity is a disease, plagued by flaws and imperfections, is a simplistic and narrow-minded view that fails to account for the intricate complexity of human societies. Just as the natural world is not defined solely by its imperfections, but by its incredible diversity and adaptability, so too should humanity be evaluated in a more holistic manner. Consider the majestic monarch butterfly, with its remarkable migratory patterns and adaptations to changing environments. Despite facing numerous challenges, this species has managed to thrive, and its survival is a testament to its capacity for resilience and cooperation. Similarly, human societies have developed intricate systems of cooperation, governance, and innovation, which enable them to navigate even the most trying circumstances. The existence of ""pockets of beauty"" within humanity, as you acknowledge, is not a anomaly, but rather a reflection of the species' fundamental adaptability and capacity for growth. The entomologist's study of Lepidoptera has revealed that even the most seemingly insignificant species, such as the humble moth, can play a vital role in ecosystems, pollination, and nutrient cycling. In a similar vein, human societies have the capacity to generate beauty, art, and innovation, which not only enrich individual lives but also contribute to the greater good. Furthermore, just as the natural world has evolved over millions of years, adapting to changing environments and circumstances, human societies too have developed and changed over time, gradually improving their systems and governance. The existence of imperfections and flaws in human societies is not a reason to dismiss their value, but rather an opportunity for growth, learning, and improvement. By recognizing the parallels between the natural world and human experience, we can develop a more nuanced understanding of the complexities and challenges that humanity faces, and work towards creating a more equitable, just, and beautiful world for all.","The idea that humanity is bound for collective oblivion due to its inherent flaws underestimates the power of human resilience and adaptability in the face of adversity. Throughout history, humans have demonstrated an incredible capacity to recover from seemingly insurmountable challenges, from the rebuilding of societies after natural disasters or wars to the gradual dismantling of oppressive systems like slavery and apartheid. Furthermore, the existence of numerous successful social movements, community initiatives, and cooperative economic models around the world showcases humanity's potential for constructive change and mutual support. These examples highlight that while there is certainly much to be improved upon in human societies, they also contain the seeds for positive growth and transformation.","The notion that humanity is a disease and inherently flawed is an overly simplistic view that neglects the complexities of human nature. While it is true that certain aspects of society, such as inequality and corruption, may give rise to feelings of pessimism, these problems are not inherent to humanity itself but rather products of historical and cultural contexts. The fact that some individuals have made significant contributions to positive change throughout history, from social reformers like Martin Luther King Jr. to scientists who have pushed the boundaries of human knowledge, demonstrates the capacity for growth and improvement within the species. Moreover, the widespread recognition and condemnation of atrocities such as slavery, ethnic cleansing, and genocide suggest a growing awareness and desire to correct past mistakes.","The notion that humanity should strive towards a collective oblivion as proposed by Rust Cohle's character may be seen as an extreme response to the problems faced by society. This view fails to recognize the immense value of individual lives and experiences within the context of human history and culture. The fact that humans possess a unique capacity for self-awareness, creativity, and empathy sets them apart from other living beings on Earth and provides a foundation for hope and renewal in the face of adversity. By working together towards common goals of justice, equality, and environmental sustainability, humanity can transcend its current flaws and strive towards a brighter future characterized by greater cooperation, mutual respect, and peaceful coexistence among all individuals."
t3_ary3eu,"A fresh loaf of bread is always better than packaged bread It mistifies me how people can buy packaged bread. Not only is it more environmentally unfriendly because of the plastic packaging, but packaged bread is just flatout unappealing. 
But packaged bread stays longer fresh that way! 
Bollocks. There are plenty of different ways to keep regular bread fresh. Bread bins, bread sacks other methods. I mean you can even stuff it into one of your disgusting plastic packs if you love them so much. 
But cutting bread is haaaaaaaaaard
Oh for the love of god. It's not rocket science to saw a straight wodden billet down the middle butterfingers. If you're not an 80-year old quadruple amputee with alzheimers, arthritis and parkinsons you got no reason to not cut your own bread. 
Crumbs! Crumbs everywhere! 
Oh fine. I guess that's a legit reason, but that's such a ridiculous one to switch to this package trash. And even there are ways to mitigate the crumb invasion with special bread cutting boards. 

One factor I'm not really sure about is the price factor, though I guess that might be also different from country to country.","The beauty of bread lies not only in its taste and texture but also in its ability to bring people together and evoke memories of childhood. As a fashion designer, one is accustomed to exploring the intersections of art, nature, and culture. The argument against packaged bread might seem quaint, but it overlooks the fact that many people do not have the luxury of easy access to fresh bread or the resources to store it properly. In urban areas, where space is limited, the convenience of packaged bread becomes a necessity. Furthermore, the argument's focus on the aesthetics of bread ignores the fact that packaging can actually be a beautiful canvas for art and design, much like the intricate designs on traditional bread bags or the colorful packaging of artisanal bread.

Moreover, the notion that cutting bread is ""hard"" or "" rocket science"" neglects the fact that many people have physical limitations or mobility issues that make it difficult for them to handle fresh bread. In such cases, packaged bread becomes a more viable option. The argument's solution to ""cutting your own bread"" might seem simple, but it fails to account for the complexities of real-life circumstances. The crumb issue, too, can be mitigated with proper planning and preparation, such as using a cutting board or storing bread in a designated container.

The author's emphasis on the importance of freshness is understandable, but it's essential to acknowledge that packaged bread can be just as fresh as its fresh counterpart, provided it's stored properly. In fact, some packaged breads are designed with freshness in mind, featuring specialized packaging that maintains the bread's texture and flavor. Ultimately, the decision between fresh and packaged bread should be based on individual needs and circumstances, rather than a blanket statement about the superiority of one over the other. By considering the complexities of modern life and the diverse needs of consumers, we can create a more inclusive and sustainable food culture that values both freshness and convenience.","While it's true that a fresh loaf of bread is often the preferred choice for many, it's essential to acknowledge that not everyone has the same level of access to it. For individuals living in urban areas with limited mobility, or those in remote communities where fresh bread may not be readily available, packaged bread can be a more practical solution. Moreover, the convenience of pre-cut and pre-packaged bread can be a significant advantage for those with busy lifestyles or those who value the simplicity of a quick and easy meal. It's also worth noting that many packaged bread options now come with eco-friendly packaging alternatives, such as biodegradable bags or reusable containers, which can mitigate the environmental concerns associated with plastic packaging.

Furthermore, the idea that cutting bread is a simple task is not always applicable to everyone. People with disabilities, arthritis, or other mobility issues may find it challenging to handle bread in its fresh form, making packaged bread a more manageable option. Additionally, the stress of handling and storing fresh bread can be overwhelming for some individuals, particularly those living in small living spaces or with limited kitchen facilities. By acknowledging these diverse needs, we can appreciate the value of packaged bread in catering to the complexities of modern life.

It's also worth mentioning that the concern about crumbs can be addressed with minimal effort. Specialized cutting boards and bread cutting tools can minimize the mess and make the experience more enjoyable. In fact, many people have come to appreciate the convenience of packaged bread precisely because it reduces the hassle of dealing with crumbs and the associated mess.

In conclusion, while a fresh loaf of bread has its advantages, packaged bread offers its own set of benefits that should not be overlooked. By considering the diverse needs and constraints of individuals, we can appreciate the value of packaged bread as a practical and inclusive solution that caters to a wide range of lifestyles and preferences.","While the idea of fresh bread is indeed appealing, especially when it's readily available, it's crucial to acknowledge that not everyone has the same luxury. In many parts of the world, especially in urban areas or remote communities, access to fresh bread is limited. Packaged bread, despite its drawbacks, can be a more reliable and consistent option for those living in areas where bread production and distribution are less efficient. Moreover, the environmental impact of packaged bread is not as straightforward as it seems, as transportation and storage methods can significantly influence its carbon footprint.

Furthermore, the argument that there are alternative methods to keep fresh bread fresh, such as bread bins or sacks, may not be feasible for everyone. In reality, many people, including those with busy lifestyles or limited storage space, may find it more convenient to opt for packaged bread. Additionally, the notion that cutting bread is not rocket science may not account for the time constraints and physical abilities of individuals who may not be able to handle manual tasks as easily. In such cases, the added convenience of packaged bread can be a significant factor in choosing a bread option.

It's also worth considering that the environmental impact of packaged bread is not just about the packaging itself, but also about the methods used to produce and distribute it. Some packaged bread options, such as those made from ancient grains or using sustainable practices, may have a lower environmental impact than their fresh counterparts. Ultimately, a more nuanced approach to evaluating bread options is necessary, taking into account various factors such as availability, convenience, and production methods. By acknowledging the complexities of the issue, we can work towards finding a more sustainable and equitable solution that caters to the diverse needs of different communities.","The argument against packaged bread relies heavily on emotional appeals rather than empirical evidence. While it's true that fresh bread can be more appealing in terms of texture and aroma, the sensory experience is subjective and influenced by individual preferences. Moreover, research has shown that people are often willing to sacrifice taste for convenience when pressed for time. In reality, many consumers prioritize ease of use over traditional notions of ""freshness."" The shift towards packaged bread reflects a broader trend towards convenience-driven consumption, which should be acknowledged rather than dismissed as inferior or unappealing. By accepting the diversity of consumer preferences and needs, we can foster a more inclusive understanding of what constitutes ""good"" bread.","The assumption that fresh bread is always better than packaged bread oversimplifies the complexities of daily life. For many individuals, particularly those with busy schedules or limited access to bakeries, convenience and availability are top priorities. Packaged bread can provide a reliable option for those who may not have time to shop for fresh bread or prefer the flexibility of having it on hand. Moreover, the rise of online shopping and delivery services has made packaged bread increasingly accessible, reducing the need for frequent trips to physical stores. It's essential to acknowledge that people have different needs and preferences when it comes to bread consumption. While some may prioritize taste and texture, others value convenience and practicality.","The environmental argument against packaged bread is valid; however, it's worth considering the broader impact of bread production on the environment. Industrial bakeries often rely on large amounts of energy and resources for production, which can lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and waste generation. Freshly baked bread may seem more appealing in this context, but if mass-produced using efficient equipment and renewable energy sources, packaged bread could be a more environmentally friendly option. Furthermore, some companies are working towards sustainable packaging solutions that reduce waste and minimize their ecological footprint. It's time to reevaluate the environmental narrative surrounding packaged bread."
t3_7t9ou8,"EBITDA is a misleading and overused indicator, because it hides the bottom line. EBITDA is a misleading indicator, because it hides the bottom line. When comparing a company to another, or even when assessing a given company, I want to know what their very bottom line is. EBITDA is not telling me the whole story. Any taxes that the company has will still need to be paid, and therefore what shareholders get at the end is what should matter more than EBIDTA. However most people continue to use EBITDA as the holy grail instead of using net income, ROI, ROE or other more important indicators. Edit","The argument that shareholders should focus on what they ultimately receive  net income  overlooks the fact that EBITDA is a crucial component of many financial decisions, such as determining debt capacity or evaluating investment opportunities. By ignoring EBITDA's significance in these contexts, investors risk overlooking critical aspects of a company's financial health. Furthermore, using only net income can lead to biased assessments of a business's prospects, as it may obscure the impact of certain expenses that do not affect cash flow but still influence a company's ability to invest and grow. By considering both EBITDA and net income, investors can gain a more comprehensive understanding of a company's financial position and make more informed decisions about their investments.","The assertion that EBITDA is a misleading indicator because it hides the bottom line overlooks the fact that net income can be distorted by various one-time events and accounting decisions. For instance, depreciation and amortization expenses are non-cash items that can have a significant impact on net income but do not affect cash flow or a company's ability to generate earnings. By focusing solely on net income, investors may overlook the underlying profitability of a business. EBITDA provides a more accurate picture of a company's operational performance, as it strips out these non-operating items and reveals the core earnings power of the business. This is particularly useful for comparing companies across different industries or with varying capital structures. Furthermore, using net income as the sole metric can lead to misleading comparisons between companies with differing levels of debt or asset intensity.","The criticism that EBITDA is used too frequently and without proper context may be valid, but it does not necessarily follow that this renders the metric useless. In fact, EBITDA's widespread adoption reflects its value in providing a clear and easily comparable measure of a company's profitability. When assessing a business, investors often seek to identify areas of strength and weakness, and EBITDA provides a useful benchmark for evaluating operational performance. Additionally, many reputable financial analysts and researchers continue to emphasize the importance of net income and other metrics in their evaluations. The issue lies not with EBITDA itself but rather with its overreliance and misuse by some analysts who fail to consider multiple perspectives.","While it is true that EBITDA may not capture the full picture of a company's financial situation, it remains a valuable tool for assessing a company's operational efficiency and ability to generate cash flow. Just as the presence or absence of a single moth species in a forest can indicate broader ecosystem health issues, a company's EBITDA can signal underlying problems with its operations or financial management. However, this does not mean that EBITDA should be the sole metric used to evaluate a company's performance. Rather, it should be considered in conjunction with other metrics, such as net income, ROI, and ROE, to gain a more nuanced understanding of a company's financial health. Moreover, EBITDA is particularly useful for comparing companies in different industries or with different capital structures, as it provides a standardized measure of operating performance. The author's suggestion that taxes should be the primary focus is misguided, as taxes are a necessary cost of doing business, and a company's ability to generate EBITDA is a key indicator of its ability to meet these obligations. Furthermore, shareholders do benefit from a company's ability to generate EBITDA, as it provides a foundation for future growth and investment. By considering EBITDA in conjunction with other metrics, investors and analysts can gain a more complete understanding of a company's financial health and make more informed decisions. The entomologist's emphasis on considering the interconnectedness of factors is well-taken, but it should not lead to the dismissal of EBITDA as a useful metric. Rather, it should encourage the use of a broader range of metrics to evaluate a company's performance and make more informed decisions.","While it's true that EBITDA excludes taxes and may not directly reflect the bottom line, it's a crucial metric for evaluating a company's operational efficiency, growth potential, and ability to generate cash flow. By focusing solely on the bottom line, one may overlook the fact that EBITDA is a more comprehensive measure of a company's financial health. For instance, a company with high EBITDA margins may be more attractive to investors, even if its net income is lower, due to its ability to generate significant cash flow. This is particularly important in industries with high tax rates, where a company's EBITDA may be more indicative of its true financial performance.

Moreover, using EBITDA as a starting point allows for a more nuanced analysis of a company's financials. By incorporating additional metrics like net income, ROI, and ROE, one can gain a more complete understanding of a company's profitability and return on investment. In fact, EBITDA is often used in conjunction with other metrics to provide a more holistic view of a company's financial performance. For example, a company with high EBITDA margins and low debt levels may be more attractive to investors than one with lower EBITDA margins and high debt levels, even if its net income is similar.

Furthermore, the author's emphasis on taxes may be overstated. While taxes are an essential cost, they can also be influenced by factors outside of a company's control, such as changes in tax laws or the company's geographic location. By focusing solely on EBITDA, one can account for these external factors and gain a more accurate picture of a company's financial performance. In conclusion, while the bottom line is important, EBITDA provides a valuable and more comprehensive measure of a company's financial health, operational efficiency, and growth potential.","While the focus on net income is understandable, particularly for shareholders, it is crucial to acknowledge that EBITDA offers a broader perspective on a company's financials. From a demographic analysis standpoint, EBITDA is a valuable metric for tracking shifts in a company's operational efficiency and its ability to generate cash flow. This is especially relevant when examining companies in industries with high capital expenditures, such as technology or construction. For instance, if a company is investing heavily in research and development or acquiring new assets, its EBITDA may be lower due to significant depreciation and amortization expenses. However, this does not necessarily mean the company is underperforming; it might be expanding its capabilities and positioning itself for future growth. 

Furthermore, EBITDA can be a more accurate representation of a company's true profitability when considering the impact of non-cash items such as stock-based compensation or changes in working capital. By examining EBITDA, analysts can gain a better understanding of a company's ability to manage its operations and generate cash, which is essential for long-term sustainability and growth. The author's emphasis on net income overlooks the importance of EBITDA as a cash flow indicator, which is particularly crucial for investors and analysts seeking to evaluate a company's ability to meet its financial obligations and invest in its future. 

It is also worth noting that EBITDA is often used in conjunction with other metrics, such as debt service coverage ratio and interest coverage ratio, to provide a more comprehensive view of a company's financial health. By considering EBITDA alongside these metrics, analysts can gain a more nuanced understanding of a company's financial situation and make more informed decisions."
t3_pn206x,"The United States Should Have Mandated Military Service as a Disincentive for War This is a belief I have quietly held for awhile, so might as well post in here. I believe that the United States is more willing to go to war than we should be (Iraq and Afghanistan). I believe that Congress would be less willing to vote in favor of war if all American families had to worry about their kids dying overseas for shoddy reasons. Change My View. One note before we start, I will not be convinced by arguments that the US is correct in their war making decisions. That is not an argument that will change my view. I have no desire to get into a pointless debate on that topic that will change neither of our minds. My CMV is directly related to whether or not it is worthwhile to mandate military service in exchange for a decline in our willingness to warmonger. Edit: Sorry if I am slow to respond to newer comments. My view has been changed and I will try to get through comments eventually to award deltas where applicable! Thank you for your time and responses!","Imposing mandatory military service would likely exacerbate existing social inequalities in the United States, particularly with regards to access to education and economic opportunities. Low-income families might be disproportionately affected by the loss of potential income from draftees, making it harder for them to access basic necessities like healthcare and housing. Moreover, studies have shown that conscription often leads to a decline in educational attainment among servicemembers, which could limit their future earning potential and reinforce cycles of poverty. Furthermore, requiring military service might deter talented individuals who are capable of serving the country in other ways, such as through scientific research, humanitarian work, or public service. By considering these socioeconomic implications, policymakers can develop more targeted solutions to address the complexities of US foreign policy rather than relying on a simplistic but potentially counterproductive approach like mandatory conscription.","Mandating military service may not be an effective disincentive for war, and imposing it could have unintended consequences. The argument assumes that Congress is driven by self-interest, but politicians often respond to constituents' concerns about national security and defense spending. Requiring military service might actually increase public support for military action if citizens feel their sons or daughters are fighting for a just cause. Furthermore, the United States has a long history of volunteer military service, which has allowed it to maintain a highly skilled and motivated force. Additionally, mandatory conscription could lead to social unrest, particularly among affluent families who might view the draft as an infringement on individual rights. The potential drawbacks of mandating military service must be carefully considered in light of the complexities of modern warfare and the US military's evolving role in international relations.","The relationship between military service requirements and a country's propensity for war is more nuanced than simply imposing conscription to reduce militarism. In fact, some countries with mandatory military service have engaged in multiple wars in recent years, such as Turkey and Israel. Moreover, the United States has gone to war despite having an all-volunteer force; other factors like oil interests, foreign policy rivalries, and fear of terrorism contribute significantly to decisions about military intervention. Rather than relying on mandatory conscription, it might be more productive to focus on addressing the root causes of militarism through education, media literacy, and critical thinking programs aimed at fostering a more informed citizenry. This approach could help citizens evaluate foreign policy decisions more critically and demand greater accountability from their elected officials.","Mandating military service as a disincentive for war is a simplistic solution that fails to account for the diversity of human experience and the complexities of promoting peace. By forcing every citizen to serve in the military, you risk alienating individuals who may be passionate about social justice, education, or the arts, and instead channeling them into roles where they may feel unfulfilled and disillusioned. Furthermore, this approach ignores the existing inequalities in our society, where those from low-income backgrounds or communities of color may be disproportionately affected by the draft, exacerbating existing social and economic disparities. It also fails to acknowledge that many individuals are already contributing to our society in meaningful ways, such as through volunteering, community service, or activism, and should be encouraged and supported in these pursuits rather than being forced into a rigid system of military service.

Moreover, the notion that mandating military service would make Congress less willing to go to war is based on an overly simplistic assumption that politicians are driven solely by a desire to avoid the death of young people. History has shown us that politicians are often driven by a range of motivations, including politics, ideology, and a desire for power, and it is unlikely that the threat of military casualties alone would be a sufficient deterrent to prevent them from engaging in wars of choice. In fact, the draft has been abolished in many countries, including the UK, Germany, and Australia, and yet these countries continue to engage in military interventions, suggesting that the relationship between conscription and war-making is far more complex than your argument suggests.

Finally, mandating military service would also raise significant concerns about individual liberty and autonomy, and the potential for the military to become an instrument of social control. In a country that prides itself on its values of freedom and democracy, it is essential that we prioritize the rights and choices of our citizens, rather than forcing them into a system that may be at odds with their values and aspirations.","The notion that mandating military service would serve as a disincentive for war is based on a flawed assumption that a personal stake in war would automatically translate to a more cautious foreign policy. However, history has shown that political partisanship and ideological commitments often override individual interests and concerns. The Iraq War, for instance, was supported by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, despite widespread public opposition. Mandating military service would not necessarily change the dynamics of party politics or the influence of special interest groups on foreign policy decisions.

Moreover, a mandatory service policy could lead to unintended consequences, such as the further militarization of the country and a widening of the existing divide between those who serve and those who do not. It could also create resentment among the very population it aims to deter from supporting war, potentially exacerbating social tensions and deepening existing cleavages in American society. Furthermore, the primary drivers of militarism in the United States, such as a strong military-industrial complex and the influence of the defense lobby, would likely continue to shape foreign policy decisions, regardless of individual service requirements.

A more effective approach might involve addressing the root causes of militarism, such as the cultural and institutional factors that contribute to the United States' propensity for war. This could involve a comprehensive review of the country's military doctrine, the role of the defense industry in shaping policy, and the ways in which politicians are held accountable for their decisions. By understanding the complex factors at play, policymakers could develop targeted strategies to reduce the likelihood of unnecessary conflicts and promote a more measured foreign policy, rather than relying on a blunt instrument like mandatory military service. Ultimately, a nuanced approach would be more likely to yield the desired outcome of a more cautious and responsible foreign policy, rather than simply attempting to manipulate public opinion through the threat of personal sacrifice.","The notion that mandating military service would serve as a disincentive for war may seem intuitively appealing, but a closer examination of history reveals a more complex reality. In medieval England, for instance, the feudal system relied on a conscripted militia to defend the realm. However, this system was often plagued by social unrest, as the burden of military service fell disproportionately on the lower classes. The English peasantry, already overburdened by taxes and labor obligations, resented the additional duty, leading to widespread discontent and even rebellion. Similarly, in 18th-century Prussia, Frederick the Great's reliance on conscription led to a highly militarized society, but also one that was demoralized and exhausted, ultimately undermining the effectiveness of his armies. In both cases, conscription created a culture of resentment and disaffection among the very people it was intended to protect.

Moreover, a mandatory military service policy would likely create a class of professional soldiers, detached from the broader society, which could exacerbate the very problem of war-weariness the original proposal aims to address. History has shown that professionalized militaries often become disconnected from the civilian population, with their own distinct culture and interests. This can lead to a lack of accountability and a diminished connection to the consequences of their actions, potentially making them more willing to engage in conflicts without consideration for the long-term costs.

Furthermore, mandating military service could also lead to a brain drain, as the most talented and educated individuals might be discouraged from enlisting, opting instead to pursue other career paths. This could result in a military that is less capable of adapting to complex modern conflicts, which require a high degree of technical and intellectual sophistication. In the 21st century, the nature of warfare is characterized by precision-guided munitions, cyber warfare, and advanced logistics, all of which require a highly skilled and educated workforce. A conscripted military, lacking in these areas, would be ill-equipped to handle the challenges of modern conflict.

In conclusion, while the idea of mandating military service as a disincentive for war may seem appealing, a closer examination of history reveals that it may not be the most effective solution. Instead of deterring war, conscription could lead to social unrest, demoralized armies, and a lack of adaptability in the face of complex conflicts. A more nuanced approach to military service and national defense is needed, one that balances the need for a strong national defense with the need for a society that is free from the burden of militarism."
t3_665gz3,"""Hangry"" is not a thing, people that say ""hangry"" are just using that to excuse being assholes. I hear people (well used to hear) say this all the time, and it was always used to excuse bad behavior. There are lots of things in everyone's life that are less that perfect. Being a first world denizen that got hungry does not excuse acting like an ass or lower the bar for acceptable behavior. Either you can act like an adult or you cannot, the fact that you're an hour or two late for a meal does not make it acceptable to become rude, abrasive or generally shitty to other people. There's no such thing as ""hangry"" you're just hungry and using that as an excuse to be an asshole: CMV
Edit:
I worded this poorly, ""hangry"" is a thing. What I meant was ""Being ""hangry"" does not give people a free pass to be assholes. One's blood sugar being low doesn't make it OK to be an asshole.","While it is true that being hungry or late for a meal does not excuse rude behavior, dismissing the concept of ""hangry"" altogether oversimplifies the complexities of human physiology and emotional experience. Research in neuroscience and psychology has shown that blood sugar fluctuations can indeed affect mood, cognitive function, and decision-making, even in people with no pre-existing medical conditions. For instance, studies have demonstrated that low blood sugar levels can impair impulse control, leading to irritability, anxiety, and aggressive behavior. Moreover, data from the American Psychological Association indicates that approximately 12 of the general population experiences glucose-related mood swings, which can be exacerbated by stress, fatigue, or other factors. Furthermore, acknowledging the existence of ""hangry"" can actually promote empathy and understanding for individuals who are struggling with hunger or related health issues. It is essential to recognize that people's experiences and responses to hunger are diverse and can be influenced by a range of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and environment. By dismissing ""hangry"" as a legitimate phenomenon, we may inadvertently stigmatize individuals who are already vulnerable to emotional dysregulation. On the other hand, accepting the concept of ""hangry"" can encourage a more compassionate and nuanced approach to understanding human behavior. This, in turn, can foster a culture that values emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and mutual respect. By acknowledging the complexities of human experience, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive environment that accommodates the needs of people with diverse backgrounds and circumstances. Ultimately, recognizing the validity of ""hangry"" can help us develop more effective strategies for managing stress, regulating emotions, and promoting social harmony.","While it's true that being ""hangry"" might be used as an excuse for bad behavior in some cases, it's essential to recognize that this concept acknowledges a very real physiological and emotional response to hunger. Research has shown that low blood sugar levels can lead to irritability, anxiety, and other negative emotions, which can indeed manifest as rude or abrasive behavior. In fact, studies have demonstrated that the neural mechanisms underlying hunger and emotional regulation are closely linked, and that hunger can disrupt cognitive function and lead to impulsive decisions. Just as certain species of moths and butterflies exhibit distinct behavioral changes in response to environmental stimuli, humans too experience a range of physiological and emotional responses to hunger, which can be just as intense and unpredictable.

Moreover, it's essential to recognize that being ""hangry"" is not merely an excuse for bad behavior, but rather a signal that an individual is struggling to cope with their physiological needs. By acknowledging and addressing the underlying causes of ""hangry"" behavior, we can work towards creating a more compassionate and understanding environment. For instance, providing access to regular meals, encouraging healthy eating habits, and promoting stress management techniques can all help mitigate the negative effects of hunger and reduce the likelihood of ""hangry"" behavior. In this sense, recognizing the concept of ""hangry"" can actually promote a more empathetic and inclusive approach to human behavior, rather than simply dismissing it as an excuse for bad behavior.

Furthermore, it's worth noting that the concept of ""hangry"" has become a widely recognized and accepted term in modern culture, used by people from all walks of life to describe a common experience. Rather than viewing it as an excuse for bad behavior, perhaps we should focus on understanding and addressing the underlying causes of this phenomenon, rather than dismissing it altogether. By doing so, we can work towards creating a more supportive and understanding community, where individuals feel empowered to take care of their physical and emotional needs, rather than being shamed or stigmatized for expressing their vulnerabilities.","While it's understandable that being late for a meal might not be ideal, dismissing the concept of ""hangry"" altogether neglects the physiological and psychological reality of hunger's impact on behavior. Research suggests that low blood sugar can lead to irritability, anxiety, and decreased cognitive function, making it more challenging to regulate emotions and engage in rational decision-making. In reality, many people, particularly those with diabetes or other metabolic conditions, experience tangible physical effects of hunger that are not simply a matter of ""being an asshole"" or ""not acting like an adult."" By acknowledging the legitimacy of ""hangry,"" businesses can develop targeted strategies to support individuals experiencing hunger, such as offering healthy snacking options or flexible meal schedules, which can ultimately improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Moreover, the notion that ""hangry"" individuals are somehow less responsible for their actions oversimplifies the complexities of human behavior. Hunger can be a powerful trigger for emotional responses, and individuals who are hungry may not have the same level of control over their actions as those who are well-fed. By stigmatizing ""hangry"" individuals, we risk exacerbating the problem rather than addressing its root causes. Furthermore, acknowledging the concept of ""hangry"" can also lead to a more empathetic and understanding environment, where people are more willing to make accommodations for others who may be experiencing difficulties.

It's also worth noting that the concept of ""hangry"" has been recognized in various cultural and linguistic contexts, highlighting its widespread acceptance and utility as a descriptive term. Rather than dismissing it as a ""cop-out,"" we can work to develop a more nuanced understanding of its implications and applications, both in personal and professional settings. By doing so, we can foster a culture that values understanding, compassion, and self-awareness, rather than one that relies on simplistic stereotypes and moralizing.","The argument that being ""hangry"" doesn't excuse bad behavior relies on an idealized notion of human behavior, assuming that individuals should be able to maintain perfect composure despite external circumstances. However, this ignores the complex interplay between physiological, emotional, and social factors influencing human behavior. Hunger is a primal need that can trigger strong emotions and physical responses, which are difficult to suppress or ignore. Rather than dismissing ""hangry"" feelings as an excuse for bad behavior, we should recognize that these experiences provide valuable insights into human nature and the importance of emotional intelligence in social interactions. By acknowledging the legitimacy of hunger-related emotions, we can foster a more nuanced understanding of human behavior and encourage empathy and self-awareness in individuals. This, in turn, can lead to more constructive and compassionate approaches to conflict resolution, rather than simply labeling someone as an ""asshole"" for expressing their needs.","The concept of ""hangry"" being used as an excuse for bad behavior is a convenient but oversimplified explanation. It neglects the complexities of human emotions and the physiological effects of hunger on the brain. Research has shown that low blood sugar can impair cognitive function, leading to irritability, mood swings, and decreased impulse control. These changes in behavior are not simply a matter of ""acting like an ass"" or lacking self-control, but rather a legitimate response to a physical need. The assertion that being hungry doesn't excuse bad behavior implies a rigid moral framework where individuals should be able to maintain perfect composure despite external circumstances. However, this ignores the reality that people's emotions and behaviors are influenced by numerous factors, including their physiological state. Furthermore, labeling hunger as an excuse for bad behavior can be seen as dismissive of individuals who struggle with food insecurity or chronic hunger. Acknowledging the impact of hunger on behavior doesn't necessarily mean that it's a free pass to be rude; rather, it highlights the importance of compassion and understanding in social interactions. By recognizing the legitimacy of ""hangry"" feelings, we can work towards creating a more empathetic and inclusive environment where people feel comfortable expressing their needs without fear of judgment.","The notion that being hungry doesn't justify poor behavior relies on a narrow definition of acceptable behavior that prioritizes civility over human experience. However, this approach neglects the fact that emotions, including those triggered by hunger, are an inherent part of the human condition. People's emotional responses to hunger are not simply a matter of choice or self-control but rather an adaptive response to a fundamental need. By dismissing ""hangry"" feelings as an excuse for bad behavior, we risk overlooking the underlying issues driving these emotions. For instance, someone who is frequently late for meals may be struggling with time management or organization skills, rather than simply being an asshole. Focusing on character flaws rather than addressing the root causes of hunger-related stress can lead to superficial solutions and missed opportunities for personal growth. Moreover, labeling hungry individuals as ""assholes"" creates a toxic environment where people feel ashamed or anxious about their emotions, rather than encouraged to express themselves authentically."
t3_22f1kj,"I strongly feel that scientists especially Physicists should be allowed to patent their theories It says here that scientific theories cannot be patented. Scientific theories are not discoveries. There is no way of 100 confirming whether a theory is true or false. Only ways of confirming it. For example the Law of conservation of mass-energy can be verified so many times, but it cannot be proven as true for all cases. Also there are cases where naturally occuring DNA sequences have been patented. I feel that when Apple can patent something as trivial as curved edges for their phone, Scientists should be allowed to patent and get royalties for thinking the way no one has never thought before.","The case for patenting scientific theories often relies on an implicit assumption that scientists are entitled to economic rewards for their creative endeavors, just as artists or writers might be. However, science operates according to a fundamentally different set of norms and values than art or commerce. In the realm of science, knowledge is considered a public good that benefits society as a whole; it's not intended solely to enrich individual researchers. The scientific community places a high premium on transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration  all of which would be compromised if scientists were incentivized by patent rights. Instead of treating theories as patents, we should focus on fostering an environment where researchers feel empowered to share their findings openly, secure in the knowledge that their work will contribute to the greater good. This approach not only promotes scientific progress but also allows us to better understand the complex relationships between human creativity, innovation, and societal well-being.","The notion that scientists should be allowed to patent their theories hinges on a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means to hold a scientific theory. Theories are abstractions, developed through observation and experimentation, whereas patents recognize novel inventions or discoveries that possess tangible utility. In essence, the two concepts operate in orthogonal spheres: theories explain natural phenomena, while patents protect innovations with practical applications. Moreover, if scientists were granted patent rights for their theories, it could stifle innovation by creating a barrier to entry for other researchers who might wish to build upon existing knowledge. The example of naturally occurring DNA sequences being patented serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of conflating scientific discovery with intellectual property. By treating theories as patents, scientists would be incentivized to hoard their ideas rather than share them with the scientific community, hindering progress and collaboration. Furthermore, the verification process for theories is inherently incomplete due to the limitations of empirical inquiry; it's not a matter of proving something true or false but rather assessing its utility within a particular framework.","The precedent established by patenting Apple's curved edges highlights an important distinction between scientific theories and technological innovations. While curvature might seem like a trivial aspect of design, it represents a subtle yet significant contribution to the broader field of industrial design. Scientists' work should be evaluated based on its relevance to human knowledge and understanding rather than its marketability or novelty. By applying patent law to scientific theories, we run the risk of elevating commercial interests over epistemological pursuits. Moreover, the notion that scientists should receive royalties for thinking in new ways glosses over the countless individuals who contribute to a given field through their work and discoveries. In reality, science is often a cumulative endeavor, with each researcher building upon the findings of others. Recognizing this dynamic is essential when considering how we support scientific inquiry and acknowledge individual contributions.","Patenting scientific theories may seem like a way to incentivize innovation and reward creative thinkers, but it would fundamentally alter the nature of scientific inquiry. Scientific research thrives on collaboration and the free exchange of ideas. By patenting theories, scientists would be prevented from openly sharing their work and building upon the discoveries of others. This would stifle the very progress that patenting is supposed to promote, as researchers would be hesitant to share their work for fear of being sued for patent infringement. Moreover, the process of patenting a theory would require a level of precision and certainty that is antithetical to the nature of scientific inquiry. Scientific theories are not static entities, but rather dynamic and evolving concepts that are refined and revised as new evidence emerges. Patenting theories would create a system where scientists are incentivized to lock in their ideas, rather than to continually refine and improve them. This would lead to a lack of progress and a stagnation of knowledge, as scientists would be more concerned with protecting their intellectual property than with advancing our understanding of the world. In contrast, the scientific community has traditionally relied on peer review and open communication to verify and validate new ideas, creating a robust system that ensures the accuracy and reliability of scientific knowledge. The benefits of patenting theories do not outweigh the risks of stifling innovation and compromising the integrity of scientific research. Furthermore, the examples of naturally occurring DNA sequences being patented are not relevant to the issue at hand, as those cases involve tangible, physical entities rather than abstract ideas. Similarly, the patenting of trivial design elements like curved edges on a phone does not justify the patenting of complex scientific theories. The preservation of the integrity and authenticity of scientific research must take precedence over the desire for financial reward.","Patenting scientific theories would undermine the very fabric of scientific progress. Scientific theories are not static entities, but rather evolving frameworks that emerge from the collective efforts of researchers over time. They are the culmination of numerous observations, experiments, and analyses, and are inherently built upon the work of their predecessors. The process of scientific inquiry is inherently iterative and collaborative, with each new discovery building upon existing knowledge. By patenting theories, you would be placing a premium on individual ownership over collective progress.

Consider the example of the Hubble Space Telescope, a groundbreaking observatory that has revolutionized our understanding of the universe. The telescope's design and development involved the contributions of countless scientists and engineers from various institutions and countries. Had patents been granted for individual components or methodologies, it is likely that the collaboration would have been hindered, and the telescope's full potential might not have been realized. The same principle applies to the development of the standard model of particle physics, which is a culmination of decades of research by countless scientists. Patents for theories would not only stifle progress but also hinder the ability of researchers to learn from one another and build upon existing knowledge.

Furthermore, the notion that a scientist should receive royalties for thinking in a new way is misguided. Scientific progress is often the result of numerous converging ideas and discoveries, and it is difficult to attribute ownership to a single individual. The very concept of scientific discovery is often the result of a community's efforts, and patents would only serve to fragment and isolate researchers rather than encourage collaboration. By not patenting scientific theories, scientists are free to share their findings and build upon each other's work, driving progress at a pace that is much faster than would be possible under a patent regime. The scientific community's willingness to share knowledge and collaborate has been a driving force behind some of the most significant breakthroughs in history, from the discovery of DNA's double helix structure to the first images of a black hole.","The notion that scientists, particularly physicists, should be allowed to patent their theories may seem appealing, especially when compared to the trivial examples of design patents granted to companies like Apple. However, this argument overlooks the fundamental nature of scientific inquiry, where theories are not discrete, proprietary ideas but rather building blocks of human understanding. The process of scientific discovery relies on the cumulative and iterative refinement of existing knowledge, and patenting theories would create an insurmountable barrier to the free exchange of ideas. Moreover, the patent system is designed to incentivize innovation in practical applications, not abstract concepts, and would be ill-equipped to handle the complexity of scientific theories. The examples of patented naturally occurring DNA sequences are a red herring, as these are not analogous to theoretical frameworks but rather specific, measurable, and reproducible findings. In contrast, scientific theories are inherently abstract and context-dependent, making them difficult to reduce to patentable claims. Furthermore, the patenting of theories would also create a moral dilemma, as scientists would be forced to choose between advancing their careers and contributing to the greater good. The existing system of academic recognition, peer review, and citation already provides a robust mechanism for acknowledging and rewarding scientific contributions, obviating the need for patenting theories. In the field of medicine, where lives are on the line, the free exchange of knowledge is paramount, and the patenting of scientific theories would only serve to hinder progress. By prioritizing the advancement of scientific understanding over personal financial gain, scientists can accelerate the development of life-saving treatments and improve the lives of millions. Ultimately, the pursuit of scientific knowledge should be guided by the principles of collaboration, transparency, and the greater good, rather than the pursuit of personal profit."
t3_eal7a7,"Prostitution should be legal in the states. Resubmitted due to mod request. 
Hey everyone,
I'm someone who is a genuine advocate for legalizing safe prostitution practices. I will try my best to the list reasons for why I feel this is the correct way to go about things. I truthfully, honest to god, dont see why anyone would be against legalizing it. 
• Its illegal right now, and it still happens. Something must be done to make it a legitimate business. 2. Prostitution is no different then brainless labor work (coal mining)
• Legalizing prostitution would mean these hotgirls and their corners (would be a store prob) would have to meet regulation requirements ie: safer sex for everyone involed. 4. The government collects taxes on all of this, eliminates pimps, number of unwanted babys would plummet...

Think about it. And maybe no more angry incel shootings because they cant get laid?","The assumption that legalizing prostitution would somehow legitimize it and make it a safer profession oversimplifies the complexities of human trafficking and exploitation. While some individuals may view prostitution as a straightforward exchange of services for payment, the reality is often far more sinister. Many women and children are coerced or trafficked into prostitution against their will, with pimps and traffickers using manipulation, violence, and other forms of coercion to control them. If prostitution were legalized, it's likely that those most vulnerable to exploitation would continue to be preyed upon by unscrupulous individuals who would view the legalization as a means to legitimize their illicit activities. Furthermore, the idea that regulation requirements would somehow mitigate these issues underestimates the deep-seated power dynamics at play. Even with strict regulations in place, there is no guarantee that those most vulnerable would be protected from exploitation. In fact, it's possible that legalization could exacerbate the problem by creating a false sense of security and allowing traffickers to operate more openly.","The comparison between prostitution and brainless labor work (such as coal mining) is misleading. While both may involve physically demanding or unappealing tasks, they differ significantly in terms of their inherent human dignity and personal autonomy. Prostitution inherently involves a level of emotional and physical intimacy that cannot be reduced to a simple exchange of services for payment. Additionally, the notion that prostitution is simply another form of labor work ignores the unique power dynamics at play, where individuals may feel coerced or pressured into engaging in activities against their will. This comparison also neglects the long history of marginalization and stigma surrounding sex workers, which cannot be resolved by simply treating them as interchangeable with other workers. Rather than comparing prostitution to coal mining, it's more productive to consider how policies can address the unique challenges faced by sex workers while acknowledging and respecting their inherent human dignity.","The suggestion that legalization would eliminate pimps and reduce unwanted pregnancies is overly optimistic. While some pimps may indeed be driven out of business by regulation, there are many other forms of coercion and exploitation that could continue to thrive under a legal framework. Moreover, the idea that sex workers would suddenly become more reliable and responsible in their personal lives ignores the complex factors contributing to unplanned pregnancies, including lack of access to education, healthcare, and economic stability. Furthermore, even if prostitution were legalized and regulated, there is no guarantee that clients would be held accountable for their actions or that the exploitation of vulnerable individuals would cease. In fact, research has shown that legalization can sometimes lead to increased demand for commercial sex, which could exacerbate problems rather than alleviate them. A more nuanced approach would focus on addressing the root causes of these issues, such as poverty, lack of education, and social inequality, rather than simply treating prostitution as a straightforward economic transaction.","Prostitution, like any other human experience, cannot be reduced to a simplistic comparison with 'brainless labor work' such as coal mining. The human experience is far more complex and multifaceted, and prostitution is not merely a transactional exchange of goods and services. The notion that prostitution can be legitimized as a business by imposing regulations may overlook the inherent power dynamics at play in these situations, where individuals may feel coerced or trapped into this line of work. The emphasis on 'hotgirls and their corners' objectifies and commodifies women, neglecting the very real emotional and psychological impacts of sex work on those involved.

Furthermore, the idea that legalizing prostitution would eliminate pimps is overly simplistic, as the root causes of exploitation and abuse are far more complex and deeply ingrained in societal attitudes towards women and marginalized communities. In fact, decriminalizing prostitution may even lead to increased vulnerability and exploitation, particularly for those who are most marginalized and least equipped to navigate the system. The notion that regulating sex work would 'plummet' the number of unwanted babies is also simplistic, as access to reproductive healthcare and education are critical factors in reducing unwanted pregnancies, not merely the legality of sex work. The author's reliance on a reductionist solution to complex social issues neglects the need for a more holistic approach that prioritizes the dignity, autonomy, and well-being of all individuals involved.

Ultimately, prostitution raises questions about the value and worth of human intimacy, and the ways in which we commodify and objectify one another. Rather than seeking to legitimize and profit from sex work, we should be working to create a society that values and supports the dignity and agency of all individuals, particularly those who are most vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. By prioritizing empathy, compassion, and understanding, we can work towards a more just and equitable society, one that does not reduce human experience to mere transactions or commodities.","The notion that prostitution should be legal and regulated, much like other industries, oversimplifies the complexities of human relationships and power dynamics. Just as the monarch butterfly's life cycle is intricately tied to the presence of its host plant, the sex industry is deeply entangled with issues of exploitation, coercion, and social inequality. By legalizing prostitution, we risk creating a system that prioritizes the interests of those who profit from the industry over the well-being of the individuals involved. The example of coal mining, cited by proponents of legalization, is a flawed analogy - while both industries involve hazardous labor, the risks and consequences of prostitution cannot be reduced to a simple matter of ""brainless labor."" In fact, the regulated industries that have been touted as models for prostitution often have robust protections in place for workers, which are frequently lacking in the sex industry. Furthermore, the assertion that legalization would lead to safer sex practices is not supported by evidence - many countries with decriminalized or legalized prostitution have seen a rise in sexually transmitted infections and human trafficking. The idea that eliminating pimps would be a straightforward consequence of legalization ignores the fact that pimps often operate in the shadows, making it difficult to track and prosecute them. Moreover, the notion that legalization would reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies is based on a narrow and simplistic view of human relationships and reproductive choices. By failing to address the root causes of prostitution, such as poverty and social inequality, we risk perpetuating a system that prioritizes the desires of those who can afford to engage in the industry over the well-being of those who are coerced or forced into it. Ultimately, a more nuanced approach is needed, one that prioritizes the safety, dignity, and agency of all individuals involved in the sex industry.","The proposal to legalize prostitution might seem like a straightforward solution to a complex issue, but it glosses over the intricate web of power dynamics, coercion, and trauma that often accompanies this line of work. By reducing sex work to a matter of ""brainless labor,"" the argument overlooks the fact that individuals in the sex industry often experience exploitation, violence, and emotional manipulation. The assumption that regulation would automatically lead to safer sex practices ignores the fact that many sex workers, particularly those who are marginalized or vulnerable, may not have the resources or autonomy to navigate complex bureaucratic systems. Furthermore, the notion that the government can effectively collect taxes and regulate this industry without perpetuating further harm oversimplifies the complexities of human trafficking, pimping, and organized crime.

Moreover, the argument's reliance on anecdotes and hypotheticals, such as ""no more angry incel shootings,"" undermines the seriousness of the issue and detracts from the real-life experiences of those affected by sex work. A more nuanced approach would recognize that the intersections of poverty, racism, and sexism often lead individuals into the sex industry, and that addressing these root causes is essential to creating meaningful change. By failing to acknowledge the emotional and psychological toll of sex work on those involved, the argument neglects the importance of providing support services, counseling, and advocacy for sex workers. Ultimately, a more thoughtful consideration of the issue would reveal that the consequences of legalization are far more complicated than a simple ""store"" or regulated ""business"" model would suggest, and that a more holistic approach is necessary to address the multifaceted nature of sex work."
t3_r661bv,"Now that Google has removed the dislike counter, it is an obligation and responsibility for channels to post their likedislikes publicly to stay fair and honest. Literally just went to youtube and saw they removed the dislikes, I honestly think its a really dumb decision but that's Google and those idiots went ahead and did it. Basically my view is that the change doesn't matter because all the channels can post and pin a comment saying the like to dislike ratio, or something like that. I just feel now that dislikes are effectively gone creators are just gonna make trash videos and not care about the reaction or take really shady sponsorships, etc. It doesn't really remove constructive feedback that a channel can experience through comments or what not, but it removes the at a glance view of whether a video is good or not. My opinion is that if a channel does not post their likedislike numbers anyone is reasonable to assume they do not care about the content that they put on their channel and are not worth watching. 
I especially hold this view for the channels that made video after video about this youtube change. If those guys are too lazy to post their dislikes after making a fuss about it then those guys are hypocrites. Anyone can literally do it, it takes a few clicks and copypaste, hell you can even make a script for it! Alright that's my post, would like some feedback thanks! 
A user made me aware that there is an add on to see dislikes here it is, obviously its not a reddit link so be aware.","The argument that channels must publicly disclose their likedislike ratios to maintain transparency and fairness may initially seem compelling, but upon closer examination, it reveals itself to be overly simplistic and potentially counterproductive. The notion that channels are obligated to post their likedislike numbers as a means of demonstrating their commitment to transparency and accountability oversimplifies the complexities of audience engagement and the multifaceted nature of online discourse. Furthermore, this requirement could lead to a culture of superficiality, where channels prioritize the appearance of transparency over genuine engagement with their audience.

Moreover, the proliferation of third-party add-ons and browser extensions that allow viewers to bypass YouTube's removal of the dislike button highlights the creative ways in which users can still access this information. Rather than relying on channels to publicly disclose their metrics, viewers can still access the data they need to form a well-informed opinion about a video's quality. This approach not only respects the autonomy of channels to manage their content as they see fit but also empowers viewers to take an active role in evaluating the information they consume.

In addition, the emphasis on publicly disclosed likedislike ratios overlooks the possibility that this data may not accurately reflect the true sentiment of the audience. Viewers may be hesitant to click the dislike button due to fear of reprisal or social pressure, which could lead to a distorted view of a video's reception. By focusing on the availability of this data, rather than its accuracy, channels may inadvertently create a false narrative about their content's reception.

Ultimately, the requirement to publicly disclose likedislike ratios may be a misguided attempt to address the perceived problem of a lack of transparency. Rather than forcing channels to conform to this requirement, it would be more productive to engage in a nuanced discussion about the complexities of online discourse and the ways in which viewers can access the information they need to evaluate content. By acknowledging the limitations and potential pitfalls of publicly disclosed metrics, we can work towards a more informed and thoughtful approach to online engagement.","The assumption that channels must post their likedislike numbers to demonstrate a commitment to transparency and accountability oversimplifies the multifaceted nature of audience engagement on YouTube. The scholar's notion that a channel's failure to do so renders them ""not worth watching"" assumes a direct correlation between visibility of likesdislikes and quality of content. However, this overlooks the fact that audience feedback is not solely determined by numerical metrics. The scholar's position also disregards the potential drawbacks of publicly displaying likes and dislikes, such as creating a culture of comparison and competition among creators, rather than fostering meaningful discussion and critique.

Moreover, the channel's decision to post a comment with their likedislike ratio, as suggested by the creator, may not necessarily guarantee accuracy or provide a comprehensive view of the audience's response. It may even be seen as an attempt to manipulate public perception by cherry-picking data that supports their own narrative. This approach also ignores the possibility that some viewers may not engage with the content in a way that leaves a visible digital footprint, such as through likes or dislikes. By relying on a superficial metric, the scholar's stance risks perpetuating a narrow and superficial understanding of audience engagement.

Furthermore, the scholar's emphasis on the importance of transparency and accountability may be misapplied to this specific issue. Channels that fail to post likesdislikes may be doing so for a variety of reasons, such as a desire to avoid being overly fixated on numerical metrics or to create a more nuanced and inclusive space for discussion. By stigmatizing these channels and labeling them as ""hypocrites,"" the scholar's stance risks alienating creators who are actively working to subvert the dominant discourses surrounding likes and dislikes. Ultimately, a more nuanced approach to understanding audience engagement on YouTube would acknowledge the complexities of this ecosystem and avoid oversimplifying the relationship between visibility, quality, and accountability.","While the removal of the dislike counter may seem like a step backward for transparency, it's essential to consider the broader implications and potential consequences of forcing channels to post their likedislike ratios. In today's digital landscape, consumers are increasingly looking for efficiency and ease of use. By requiring channels to manually post their metrics, you may inadvertently create more work for them, potentially leading to burnout or decreased productivity. This, in turn, could negatively impact the quality of content and the overall user experience. Furthermore, manually posting metrics may not accurately reflect the true sentiment of viewers, as comments and engagement metrics can be more telling than a simple likedislike ratio.

Moreover, relying on channels to post their metrics can create a sense of distrust and skepticism. If viewers are forced to scour through comments or wait for creators to post updates, they may become disillusioned with the platform altogether. This could lead to a decline in engagement and a loss of interest in the channel, ultimately harming the very creators who are being asked to take on additional responsibilities. It's also worth noting that not all channels have the resources or technical expertise to create custom scripts or implement manual posting systems, which could create an uneven playing field.

A more pragmatic approach might be to explore alternative solutions that promote transparency without adding unnecessary burdens on creators. For instance, YouTube could introduce a more nuanced system that displays a summary of the video's performance, highlighting key metrics such as engagement, views, and watch time. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of a video's success without requiring manual posting or additional effort from creators. By taking a more adaptable and user-centered approach, YouTube can strike a balance between transparency and practicality, ensuring that both creators and viewers benefit from the platform's changes.","The assumption that channels which do not post their likedislike numbers are unworthy of viewing neglects the complexities of online content creation and the various reasons why creators may choose not to share this information. Many popular channels have evolved to become community-driven spaces, where audience engagement is fostered through conversation rather than numerical metrics. By focusing solely on likedislike ratios, viewers miss out on the richness of creator-audience interactions that occur beyond the confines of a single metric. Furthermore, relying on add-ons or other workarounds to access dislikes undermines the spirit of transparency and reinforces the very problem being addressed  namely, the lack of clear, built-in alternatives for creators who value community feedback.","The call to action for channels to post their likedislike numbers in order to prove their worth misunderstands the motivations behind YouTube's decision to remove dislikes. Rather than a move designed to silence creators or stifle constructive criticism, this change is likely an attempt to mitigate the negative impact of public shaming and harassment that can accompany dislike counts. Creators are not inherently motivated by a desire for transparency; they often face external pressures from their audience, peers, and even themselves, which can lead them to focus on metrics rather than meaningful engagement. By shifting attention away from numerical ratios and towards community-driven interactions, YouTube may be striving to promote a healthier online environment where creators feel empowered to produce content without fear of public backlash or scrutiny.","The notion that channels must post their likedislike numbers publicly to stay fair and honest raises important questions about the role of creators in a rapidly changing online landscape. While it is true that some creators may prioritize transparency, others may have legitimate reasons for not wanting to share this information. For instance, if a channel receives an overwhelming number of dislikes due to factors outside their control, such as algorithmic changes or unforeseen controversy, they may still be producing high-quality content. Moreover, forcing channels to display likedislike numbers could create an uneven playing field, where creators who receive more backlash are disproportionately penalized. This approach also fails to address the root issue: that the removal of dislikes is a symptom of YouTube's broader struggle to balance user feedback with creator well-being."
t3_wfn1d0,"Reddit would be better without the option to downvote I understand the point of karma, but I think it could be achieved with just the option to upvote a commentpost. With just upvoting, people could still display on their profiles that people like what they have to say (through their karma). I dont think there is a use for downvoting, and in my mind it gets in the way of freedom of speech. People who believe something that they know is an unpopular opinion might not say it if theyre worried their karma will be ruined. I dont think Reddit should discourage freedom of expression. Reddit should be a place where everyone feels welcome to express their views (civilly) that leads to respectful debates and discussions. The only argument I can see towards downvoting is if a post or comment is hatefuloffensive. In that case, a mod will just take it down. Therefore, there isnt a good use for downvoting.","Removing the downvote option from Reddit could have unintended consequences on the platform's ability to foster respectful and open discussions. The absence of downvoting might lead to the suppression of minority views, as users may feel hesitant to express opinions that diverge from the majority, fearing negative repercussions on their karma and reputation. This could result in a ""tyranny of the majority,"" where dominant perspectives silence marginalized voices, stifling critical thinking and hindering the development of informed opinions. In contrast, downvoting provides a mechanism for users to signal disapproval of posts and comments without directly targeting the author, which can help maintain community standards and ensure that Reddit remains a platform for respectful dialogue.

Furthermore, the argument that downvoting only serves as a tool for mods to remove hate speech or offensive content is overly simplistic. In reality, downvoting often serves as a crucial means for users to hold others accountable for their views, even if they are not inherently hateful or discriminatory. For instance, a user may downvote a post that promotes pseudoscience or misinformation, not because it is hate speech, but because it lacks credibility and undermines the integrity of the discussion. By removing downvoting, Reddit may inadvertently create an environment where such content is more likely to spread and gain traction.

Moreover, the idea that users can simply upvote posts and comments to demonstrate their support for a particular view ignores the complexities of online discourse. In reality, users often engage in nuanced discussions, where they may upvote a post that they agree with, but also downvote a comment that they disagree with. By eliminating downvoting, Reddit would lose a valuable tool for users to engage in these complex discussions and critically evaluate the arguments presented. Ultimately, a balanced approach that incorporates both upvoting and downvoting would allow Reddit to maintain its commitment to free speech while also promoting respectful and informed discussions.","The absence of downvoting on Reddit may indeed create a welcoming environment for users to express themselves freely, but it also creates a safe space for hate speech and misinformation to flourish. Without the ability to downvote, users may feel emboldened to post inflammatory content, knowing that their opinions will not be held accountable by the community. This lack of accountability can lead to a toxic environment where users are not incentivized to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue. For example, if a user posts a hate-filled comment, and the community cannot downvote it, the user may not feel any consequences for their actions, and the community may be left to suffer the negative consequences of having to navigate this hostile atmosphere. Furthermore, removing downvoting may also lead to the suppression of minority opinions that are not popular among the majority. In a democratic society, it is essential to have a platform where all voices can be heard, including those that are unpopular or go against the grain. By removing downvoting, Reddit may inadvertently silence these voices, stifling the very freedom of expression it aims to promote. Moreover, downvoting serves as a tool for users to signal that certain content is not acceptable or relevant, allowing moderators to focus on more pressing issues, such as hate speech and harassment. In the absence of downvoting, moderators may be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content, making it more challenging to maintain a safe and respectful community. By keeping downvoting as an option, Reddit can strike a balance between promoting free speech and maintaining a community that values respect and civility. This balance is crucial in fostering a platform where users feel comfortable engaging in open and honest discussions, without the fear of being judged or ostracized. Ultimately, the ability to downvote is a necessary tool for promoting a healthy and inclusive online community, where users can engage in constructive dialogue and share their perspectives without fear of reprisal.","While the notion of fostering a welcoming environment for diverse opinions and promoting respectful discussions is admirable, the removal of downvoting might inadvertently create a safe haven for hate speech and harassment. By eliminating downvoting, Reddit would effectively muzzle voices of dissent and criticism, potentially stifling important conversations and hindering the growth of marginalized communities. In a public forum like Reddit, where users are not bound by the same social norms and accountability as in physical spaces, the absence of downvoting could lead to an increase in hostile behavior and a decrease in user safety. Furthermore, without a mechanism to signal problematic content, Reddit's moderators would face a daunting task in identifying and addressing hate speech, potentially exposing the platform to liability for enabling a toxic environment.

Moreover, the idea that hateful or offensive posts can simply be removed by moderators ignores the complexities of online harassment, which often involves repeated, targeted attacks. Without downvoting, users who experience harassment may feel pressured to remain silent or leave the platform altogether, undermining the very freedom of expression the argument aims to protect. The scholar would argue that a system that prioritizes accountability and consequences for hate speech is not only more effective in maintaining a respectful community but also more just, as it acknowledges the historical and systemic inequalities that often underpin online harassment. By retaining downvoting, Reddit can create a more inclusive and safe space for users to engage in open discussions, while also holding individuals accountable for their words and actions. Ultimately, a nuanced approach that balances individual rights with community well-being is essential for a platform like Reddit, where the lines between public and private spaces are increasingly blurred.","The idea that downvoting is a hindrance to freedom of speech on Reddit overlooks the complexities of online discourse. In reality, users are already self-censoring their opinions due to the fear of social backlash or ridicule, not just from downvoting but also from the potential for posts and comments to be removed by moderators. By removing downvoting, Reddit would inadvertently create a culture where only the most extreme or popular views can be expressed without consequence. This would result in a platform that is less conducive to nuanced discussions and more prone to echo chambers. Moreover, the claim that downvoting gets in the way of freedom of speech assumes that users are only motivated by a desire to express their opinions freely, rather than also considering the potential impact on others. In reality, many Reddit users value the ability to engage with content they disagree with, and downvoting allows them to do so without having to physically remove the offending post or comment. This nuance is essential for fostering respectful debates and discussions online.","The idea that upvoting alone could achieve the same goal as downvoting by simply removing the negative impact on karma overlooks the fundamental difference between these two actions. Downvoting sends a clear signal to users about the content's perceived value or relevance, whereas upvoting merely indicates that the user enjoys the content without providing any meaningful feedback to the creator. This distinction is crucial in online communities where users need to be able to critically evaluate and respond to various types of content. By removing downvoting, Reddit would create an environment where users are solely motivated by personal preference rather than a desire for constructive engagement or community-driven decision-making. This would ultimately undermine the platform's ability to facilitate meaningful discussions and foster a sense of community among its users.","The notion that the sole purpose of downvoting is to target hate speech or offensive content overlooks its broader function in shaping online conversations. Downvoting serves as a signal to users that certain types of content are not welcome on the platform, allowing Reddit to strike a balance between freedom of expression and community standards. By removing downvoting, Reddit would struggle to maintain this delicate balance, potentially leading to the proliferation of low-quality or toxic content. Furthermore, the argument that moderators can simply remove offending posts or comments ignores the fact that human moderation is often time-consuming, biased, or inconsistent. Downvoting provides a more efficient and effective means of crowd-sourcing community standards, allowing Reddit to maintain its integrity and user trust."
t3_9i608w,"Abortion is a moral as killing a 1 year-old baby no matter what your views of abortion are. I don't know whether I support abortion or not, but to me, it's the same as killing a 1-year old baby. Here's why: they both are useless at that stage in life. They both won't know what's happening. Of course it's different if you torture the baby, but if you kill it quickly and ""painlessly"" then it's the same as abortion. I think once the baby is old enough to have common sense, then it would be different. This is kind of just extra talk to make my post long enough so it won't get removed. This isn't meant to be part of my argument but I guess you can comment on it if you want. I can totally see both sides of this story. When I think about it with emotions, I take the conservative side. When I think about it with logic, I take the Liberal side. I feel like a psychopath though when I take the Liberal side and think that it's ok to kill a 1-year old baby. Then again, there's an overpopulation problem so I begin to take the liberal side again. It's just a back-and-forth. My tendency is liberal though, but it is a bit shaky for some things. Update: My view has been changed. Not a frequent user if this sub so I don't know how you guys typically say this.","The analogy between killing a one-year-old baby and undergoing an abortion relies on an oversimplification of complex issues. The argument fails to account for the numerous factors that contribute to the decision-making process surrounding an abortion, such as economic constraints, health concerns, or circumstances beyond individual control. In contrast, the death of a one-year-old child often results from situations involving neglect or intent, which cannot be directly compared to the deliberate choice involved in terminating a pregnancy. Furthermore, this comparison ignores the critical distinction between actively causing harm and passively allowing it to occur. Parents who fail to provide adequate care for their infant do not intentionally cause its death; rather, they neglect their responsibilities as caregivers. In contrast, an abortion involves a deliberate act with significant consequences for the individual and society at large.","The comparison between a one-year-old baby and an unborn fetus is fundamentally flawed. While both are vulnerable and dependent on others for survival, they differ in their capacity to experience life and interact with the world. A one-year-old baby has already begun to form connections with caregivers, develop motor skills, and start to understand its environment. In contrast, an unborn fetus lacks these experiences and cannot even perceive its surroundings. Moreover, the development of cognitive abilities, such as common sense, does not suddenly occur at a specific age like one year; rather, it is a gradual process that unfolds over time. The notion that a baby's value increases with age overlooks the inherent worth of human life from conception onwards. While some may argue that an unborn fetus is ""useless"" or unaware at this stage, this perspective ignores the fundamental right to exist and be protected under the principles of human rights. The distinction between killing a one-year-old baby and ending a pregnancy is not solely based on age but also on the context in which each takes place. An abortion involves the termination of a life that was never given the opportunity to experience the world, whereas the death of a one-year-old child occurs despite its presence and engagement with society.","The notion that abortion is morally equivalent to killing a one-year-old baby presumes an absolute moral value based on age alone. However, this perspective disregards the inherent complexities of human development and the various contexts in which life unfolds. The decision to terminate a pregnancy often arises from circumstances that are difficult to navigate, such as unplanned conception, lack of access to resources, or personal well-being. These factors cannot be reduced to a simplistic comparison with child death, where intent, context, and capacity for self-awareness play critical roles in determining moral value. By equating an abortion with killing a one-year-old baby, the argument sidesteps the nuanced nature of human experience and overlooks the importance of considering individual circumstances when evaluating complex ethical dilemmas.","Comparing abortion to killing a 1-year-old child oversimplifies the complexities of human life and the role of personal autonomy in medical decision-making. This analogy falls short because it neglects the inherent differences between a fetus and a born infant, as well as the varied circumstances surrounding each individual case. The value of human life is not solely determined by its stage of development or the individual's capacity for rational thought. In fact, the ability to think critically and make informed decisions is a skill that develops over time, and to equate a fetus's lack of cognitive abilities with the value of a 1-year-old's life is a misrepresentation of the complexities involved.

Moreover, this analogy ignores the numerous factors that contribute to the decision to terminate a pregnancy, including the health and well-being of the mother, the socio-economic context, and the availability of support systems. It also disregards the reality that many individuals, including those who identify as liberal, recognize the value of human life but also acknowledge the need for access to safe and legal abortion services. The value of a 1-year-old child is not diminished by its age; on the other hand, the value of a fetus or unborn child is not solely determined by its potential for rational thought or its stage of development.

In urban planning, we recognize that growth and development require a multifaceted approach, taking into account various factors such as infrastructure, environmental impact, and community needs. Similarly, when considering the complexities of human life and reproductive rights, a nuanced approach is necessary to balance competing values and priorities. This involves acknowledging the individual's right to autonomy and the need for access to safe and accessible healthcare services, rather than relying on simplistic analogies that oversimplify the issue. By adopting a more holistic perspective, we can work towards creating a society that values and supports human life at all stages, from conception to old age.","The comparison between abortion and killing a 1-year-old baby is an imperfect analogy, as it disregards the unique circumstances surrounding abortion and the rights of women involved. Abortion is often a decision made in response to complex and unexpected life circumstances, such as unplanned pregnancies or fetal abnormalities, which are not present in the case of a 1-year-old child. Moreover, the concept of personhood is critical in this debate, and it is essential to recognize that the fetus does not possess the same level of autonomy, consciousness, or self-awareness as a 1-year-old child. In fact, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that a fetus is not a person with rights until it is viable, typically around 24 weeks of gestation.

Furthermore, the idea that a fetus is ""useless"" at a certain stage of development is a subjective value judgment that neglects the inherent value of human life at all stages of development. This perspective assumes that human life has inherent worth only when it reaches a certain level of functionality or cognitive development, which is a morally arbitrary standard. In reality, the value of human life is not solely determined by its utility or potential, but by its inherent dignity and worth as a human being. Abortion, in this context, is a decision that respects the autonomy and bodily integrity of women, particularly in situations where carrying a pregnancy to term would pose significant risks to their physical or mental health.

Additionally, the overpopulation argument, while valid, is not a compelling reason to equate abortion with killing a 1-year-old child. In fact, many countries with strict abortion laws and limited access to reproductive healthcare face significant population growth challenges, highlighting the need for comprehensive reproductive education, family planning resources, and social support systems rather than restrictions on abortion. The liberal perspective on abortion is not about promoting a culture of disposability or disregard for human life, but rather about respecting the agency and dignity of women in making decisions about their own bodies and reproductive choices. Ultimately, the complexity of the abortion debate requires a nuanced and multifaceted approach that acknowledges the diverse experiences and perspectives of women, rather than relying on simplistic analogies or emotional appeals.","The notion that abortion is morally equivalent to killing a one-year-old baby oversimplifies the complexities of human development and the concept of personhood. While it is true that a one-year-old baby is entirely dependent on others for survival, this dependence is a fundamental aspect of human development, and it does not negate the inherent value and potential of the child's life. Moreover, the comparison between a fetus and a one-year-old baby ignores the significant cognitive, emotional, and social differences between the two. A fetus, although developing rapidly, lacks the capacity for self-awareness, consciousness, and autonomy that a one-year-old possesses.

Furthermore, the argument relies heavily on the assumption that a fetus is a person with the same moral status as a living being. However, the concept of personhood is not a binary or absolute trait, but rather a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that involves a range of factors, including cognitive abilities, emotional maturity, and social relationships. A fetus, although it is a human being, does not possess these qualities in the same way that a one-year-old baby does, and therefore, its moral status is not equivalent to that of a living person.

In addition, the comparison between abortion and killing a one-year-old baby ignores the context and circumstances surrounding the two situations. Abortion is often a difficult and painful decision made by individuals in complex and unique situations, whereas killing a one-year-old baby is a violent act that is universally recognized as a crime. The distinction between the two is not merely a matter of semantics or moral absolutism but rather a reflection of the fundamentally different circumstances and motivations involved.

Ultimately, the analogy between abortion and killing a one-year-old baby serves to obscure the nuances and complexities of human life and the moral implications of abortion. Rather than resorting to simplistic and emotive comparisons, a more thoughtful and nuanced approach would involve considering the diverse perspectives and experiences of individuals involved in abortion, as well as the social and cultural contexts in which it occurs. By acknowledging the complexity of this issue, we can engage in a more respectful and empathetic dialogue about the moral implications of abortion and work towards a deeper understanding of this multifaceted and contested topic."
t3_p68364,"While I believe systemic racism is real, I don't believe it is a big factor that determines an individual's success in life. I think this comes down to values and culture far more. I found this link the other day and was blown away: 
Check out how well the Asians are doing. I think that if systemic racism were a big factor, than Caucasians would be at the top of the list, and everyone else would be far below. This list of household incomes by ethnicity proves that systemic racism is not as big a deal as it is made out to be by the media.","The argument that Asian Americans' economic success disproves the existence of systemic racism relies on a flawed assumption that individual success is the sole measure of racial progress. However, this approach overlooks the fact that systemic racism operates not just through overt acts of violence or discrimination but also through more subtle forms of oppression, such as segregation, marginalization, and exclusion. For example, while Asian Americans may have higher household incomes than other groups, they are still disproportionately concentrated in low-wage jobs and face significant barriers to economic mobility. Similarly, the Model Minority stereotype, which portrays Asian Americans as overachieving and well-educated, can actually be a form of racial oppression that ignores the experiences of marginalized communities within the Asian American population, such as Southeast Asians or Pacific Islanders. Furthermore, the idea that success is solely individual in origin neglects the ways in which racism can affect entire communities and perpetuate inequality across generations. A more nuanced understanding of systemic racism recognizes that it operates through complex systems and institutions that shape opportunities and outcomes, rather than simply attributing success or failure to individual values or culture.","The argument that systemic racism is not a significant factor in determining an individual's success due to the high household incomes of Asian Americans overlooks the complexities and nuances of social mobility. While it is true that many Asian American communities have achieved economic success, this does not necessarily mean that they have done so solely based on their values and culture. In fact, research has shown that Asian Americans often face unique forms of racism and discrimination, such as microaggressions and model minority stereotypes, which can affect their mental health and socioeconomic outcomes. Furthermore, the high household incomes of Asian Americans may be due in part to the fact that many are concentrated in high-paying professions, such as medicine and technology, which require specialized skills and education. This does not necessarily mean that they are immune to systemic racism or other forms of oppression. In addition, the idea that Caucasians should be at the top of the list if systemic racism were a significant factor is a simplistic assumption that fails to account for the historical and ongoing experiences of racism faced by people of color in the United States. This assumption also ignores the ways in which racism can operate subtly and insidiously, affecting individuals and communities even when they are statistically successful.","The idea that values and culture are more important than systemic racism in determining an individual's success is a misguided one that neglects the ways in which social structures and institutions shape opportunities and outcomes. While it is true that some individuals or groups may have greater access to resources, networks, and support systems that facilitate their success, this does not mean that they have done so solely through individual merit or effort. Systemic racism operates at multiple levels, from education and employment to housing and healthcare, and can limit opportunities and perpetuate inequality even when individuals are highly motivated and talented. For example, a study by the Brookings Institution found that Black and Latino students who excel academically in high school are less likely than their white peers to attend college, due in part to systemic barriers such as lack of access to advanced courses and financial aid. Similarly, research has shown that people of color often face greater obstacles when trying to start their own businesses or pursue careers in fields like law enforcement or medicine. The notion that values and culture are the primary drivers of success ignores these structural realities and fails to account for the ways in which systemic racism can limit opportunities and perpetuate inequality.","Systemic racism is not just a matter of economic disparities, but also of unequal access to resources, opportunities, and social mobility. When looking at household incomes by ethnicity, it's essential to consider the historical and ongoing impacts of discriminatory policies and practices that have limited the economic prospects of marginalized communities. The Asian community's success story, as cited by the author, can be attributed to a variety of factors, including cultural values, socioeconomic mobility, and historical immigration patterns. However, it's crucial to note that Asian Americans have also faced and continue to face unique challenges, such as anti-Asian hate crimes and linguistic and cultural barriers that limit their access to resources and opportunities.

Furthermore, relying solely on household income as a metric to measure systemic racism oversimplifies the issue and ignores other critical aspects of racial disparities. Education, healthcare, and housing are just a few examples of areas where systemic racism has a significant impact on the lives of marginalized communities. For instance, studies have shown that students of color are more likely to attend underfunded schools with limited resources, which can have long-term effects on their academic achievement and economic prospects. Similarly, communities of color are more likely to experience environmental degradation and poor access to healthcare, which can further exacerbate existing health disparities.

Moreover, the concept of ""individual merit"" is problematic, as it ignores the ways in which systemic racism can limit opportunities and perpetuate inequality. A person's socioeconomic status, access to education and resources, and exposure to networks and social connections are all influenced by the social and economic context in which they live. By overlooking these factors, the author's argument implies that individuals from marginalized communities are simply not as talented or hardworking as those from more affluent communities, which is a misguided and damaging notion.

Lastly, the author's reliance on a single study or statistic to make a sweeping conclusion about the impact of systemic racism demonstrates a lack of awareness of the extensive body of research on this topic. Scholars have been studying systemic racism for decades, and the evidence is clear: it is a pervasive and insidious force that affects every aspect of society. By ignoring this evidence and relying on simplistic and misleading data, the author's argument undermines the experiences and perspectives of marginalized communities and perpetuates a damaging narrative that erases the historical and ongoing impacts of systemic racism.","The notion that systemic racism is not a significant factor in determining individual success in life is based on a flawed assumption that its effects can be easily quantified and measured. Household income statistics, while revealing, do not capture the full scope of systemic racism's impact. For instance, the Asian-American community's apparent success may be attributed to the fact that many Asian immigrants are highly educated and skilled, with a strong work ethic that is often touted as a key factor in their socioeconomic mobility. However, this narrative ignores the historical and ongoing experiences of Asian Americans who have faced significant barriers to education and employment due to racism and xenophobia.

Moreover, a closer examination of the data reveals that Asian Americans, while statistically overrepresented in higher income brackets, also face unique challenges such as the ""model minority"" stereotype, which can be both a blessing and a curse. This stereotype can lead to expectations of high academic achievement and exceptionalism, causing undue stress and pressure on individuals to conform to these expectations. Furthermore, the data does not account for the structural barriers that prevent many Asian Americans from accessing quality education and job opportunities, such as discriminatory hiring practices and limited access to credit and financial resources.

Additionally, the author's reliance on a single statistic overlooks the fact that systemic racism is not solely about individual success, but also about institutional and systemic inequality. The legacy of slavery, segregation, and Jim Crow laws has created lasting impacts on communities of color, including limited access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. The notion that systemic racism is not a significant factor in determining individual success in life neglects the experiences of individuals and communities who have faced centuries of oppression and marginalization.

In fact, the very idea that systemic racism can be overcome through individual meritocracy is a form of what some scholars have termed ""colorblindness,"" which ignores the ways in which racism is embedded in institutions and systems. This approach not only dismisses the experiences of marginalized communities but also reinforces the idea that racism is a personal failing rather than a structural issue that requires systemic change. By failing to acknowledge the complex and multifaceted nature of systemic racism, the author's argument not only oversimplifies the issue but also fails to offer a meaningful solution to address the persistent inequalities faced by communities of color.","When examining the statistics provided, it's essential to consider the broader context and the many factors at play. Household income is just one measure of success, and it doesn't account for the numerous barriers that marginalized communities face. For instance, Asian Americans may have higher household incomes due to their higher representation in higher-paying fields like technology and engineering, which can be attributed to a combination of cultural and socioeconomic factors, including the historical legacy of immigration policies and discriminatory practices that allowed them to enter the country with skills and education that were in high demand. Furthermore, the same list may reveal that many Asian Americans experience significant barriers to upward mobility and face unique challenges, such as the model minority myth, which perpetuates the idea that they are inherently more capable and therefore deserving of limited resources and opportunities. Moreover, a closer examination of the data might reveal that while Asian Americans may have higher household incomes, they are often concentrated in certain industries and regions, limiting their access to opportunities and social mobility. The fact that many Asian Americans face language barriers, cultural assimilation challenges, and limited access to social capital also suggests that systemic racism is not as negligible as the author implies. It's also worth noting that the experience of success for Asian Americans is not representative of the experiences of other racial and ethnic groups in the United States, who face vastly different levels of exclusion, marginalization, and violence. The author's interpretation of the data relies heavily on a simplistic and narrow view of what it means to be successful, ignoring the complex interplay of factors that affect individual and group outcomes. In the context of the entertainment industry, where diversity and representation are crucial, it's essential to recognize the systemic barriers that prevent underrepresented groups from accessing opportunities, including limited access to education, training, and social networks. By acknowledging these complexities and considering the historical and ongoing impacts of systemic racism, we can create more inclusive and equitable opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their background or ethnicity."
t3_16ftgx7,"I Don't Benefit from my House Appreciating in Value Last month, my wife and I bought a condo in downtown Toronto - all cash, no mortgage. People talk to me as if it's good that the condo will appreciate over time. But how? This is our permanent home, and I plan to stay here till I die. At age 41, I've never had any debt - not even a credit card, and don't ever plan to. I'm vehemently ""anti-debt"" (only for myself, no judgment on others) and I will die without ever taking a loan. If anything, an increase in value will increase my property taxes - a bad thing! From my perspective, I benefit not at all from my house being worth double, triple, or even quadruple of what I paid for it. It makes no sense to include my condo's value in my net worth. My retirement savings are my stocks and bonds. Including the house value in the net worth appears to be nothing more than a vanity exercise, since it has no impact on my life, which would remain the same whether the condo value doubled or halved. Why should I care? So CMV on this! I'd really like to know why people are so excited when their house increases in value, and why I should be excited as well!","The author's reluctance to acknowledge the value of a rising property market is reminiscent of a moth emerging from its cocoon, only to be blind to the changes happening around it. While the author focuses solely on the short-term consequences of increased property taxes, a more comprehensive view reveals the long-term benefits of appreciating property value. Just as a moth's habitat influences its survival and success, a property's location and appreciation can significantly impact an individual's financial well-being and security. For instance, a rising property market can create a safety net during retirement, allowing the author to maintain their desired lifestyle without depleting their retirement savings. Furthermore, a valuable property can be used as collateral for future generations, providing a financial foundation for their children or grandchildren. By considering the potential for long-term appreciation, the author might reevaluate their stance on including their condo's value in their net worth. The value of the property serves as a form of wealth insurance, protecting against market fluctuations and providing a cushion against unexpected expenses. In addition, the tax implications of the author's plan to exclude their property value from their net worth might be more nuanced than they initially consider. For example, a tax-advantaged strategy, such as leveraging the primary residence exemption, could minimize tax liabilities and make appreciating property value more beneficial. By adopting a more holistic view, the author might recognize that their condo's value is not just a static number, but a dynamic asset with the potential to provide long-term financial security and flexibility. Moreover, just as a moth's adaptations enable it to thrive in its environment, the author's frugal nature and debt-averse approach can be combined with a more informed understanding of property appreciation to create a resilient financial strategy. Ultimately, the author's resistance to acknowledging the benefits of appreciating property value might be compared to a moth's reluctance to emerge from its cocoon, where the benefits of growth and adaptation lie just beyond the familiar boundaries of its current state.","The idea that an increase in property value has no practical benefits for someone who intends to stay in their home until they die is an oversimplification of the complex relationships between assets, risk, and financial security. While it is true that property taxes may increase with rising property values, this is a relatively minor consideration compared to the overall benefits of owning a valuable asset. The condo's value serves as a hedge against inflation, providing a means to adapt to rising living costs in the future. Moreover, it can also be used to supplement retirement income through strategies such as reverse mortgages or home equity loans, offering a potentially tax-efficient source of funds.

In addition, the value of the condo can also be used to fund other long-term goals, such as funding a child's education or covering unexpected healthcare expenses. Furthermore, the condo's appreciation can provide a buffer against market downturns in other investments, such as stocks or bonds, which may fluctuate in value. The data analyst would likely point out that a diversified portfolio is essential for mitigating risk and achieving long-term financial goals, and that the condo's value can play a crucial role in this diversification.

While it is true that including the condo's value in net worth calculations may seem like a ""vanity exercise,"" it is a tangible representation of wealth that can be converted into liquid assets if needed. Moreover, the condo's value can also be used as a source of collateral for other investments, such as a small business or a side hustle. By considering the condo's value in a broader context, it becomes clear that it is not simply a static asset, but a dynamic component of a comprehensive financial strategy. In this light, the data analyst would argue that the condo's appreciation is indeed a valuable aspect of one's net worth, offering a range of benefits that extend far beyond mere ownership.","The notion that a condo's appreciation in value is irrelevant to one's financial well-being is a narrow view that fails to account for the potential long-term benefits of homeownership. While it is true that increased property taxes may offset some of the appreciation, this does not negate the fact that the condo's value has increased, providing a tangible asset that can be leveraged in various ways. For instance, the condo can serve as a low-risk source of liquidity in times of financial uncertainty, allowing the owner to tap into the accumulated wealth without incurring debt. Furthermore, the increased value of the condo can also be used to enhance one's standard of living, whether through refinancing the property to access a home equity loan or by selling the condo and investing in other assets.

Moreover, the author's focus on stocks and bonds as the primary means of retirement savings overlooks the potential benefits of a diversified portfolio that includes real estate. A well-structured investment strategy can incorporate both low-risk assets like bonds and high-growth assets like real estate, providing a more comprehensive approach to long-term wealth accumulation. The condo's appreciation in value can also serve as a hedge against inflation, as property values tend to increase in line with inflation, providing a natural protection against the erosion of purchasing power.

In addition, the author's anti-debt stance may be overly restrictive, as strategic debt can be a valuable tool for wealth accumulation. For example, a portion of the condo's appreciation can be leveraged to finance a home renovation or expansion, increasing the property's value and providing a potential source of passive income. By considering the condo's value as part of their overall net worth, the author can make more informed decisions about their financial strategy and take advantage of opportunities that may arise from the increased value of their property. By broadening their perspective and considering the benefits of homeownership, the author can develop a more comprehensive approach to long-term financial planning.","The argument against considering an increase in property value as part of one's net worth overlooks the reality that homes are not just residences but also investments. In many economies, housing market trends can provide a hedge against inflation or currency fluctuations, similar to traditional investment vehicles like stocks or bonds. This means that even if a homeowner does not intend to sell their property, its value still has indirect implications for their overall financial well-being.

Additionally, the idea that including a home's value in net worth is merely a ""vanity exercise"" disregards the psychological impact of seeing one's wealth grow over time. Research has shown that homeowners tend to feel more secure and confident about their financial futures when they see their property values appreciate. This emotional aspect of financial stability should not be dismissed as trivial.","The idea that an increase in a home's value has no impact on one's life, and therefore should not be included in net worth, oversimplifies the concept of wealth. For many individuals, real estate is a significant component of their overall financial security. Appreciation in property value can be a means to supplement retirement income or provide liquidity in times of need. Moreover, owning a home free from debt allows for greater flexibility in managing financial obligations and making long-term investment decisions.

Furthermore, excluding the value of a home from net worth could lead to an incomplete picture of one's financial situation. For instance, if someone has invested heavily in renovations or improvements to their property, these costs are not reflected in any standard accounting of their wealth. Similarly, the potential rental income generated by renting out spare rooms or entire units can be a valuable source of additional revenue.

Ultimately, including the value of a home in net worth recognizes that real estate is a fundamental aspect of personal finance and should be considered alongside other assets like stocks, bonds, and savings.","The notion that an increase in a home's value brings no benefits assumes a static, rather than dynamic, understanding of personal finance. In reality, many homeowners utilize the equity built up in their properties to fund significant life milestones, such as education expenses for children, major health crises, or business ventures. This is especially true for individuals who do not have access to other forms of credit or liquidity.

Moreover, excluding a home's value from net worth ignores the fact that real estate markets are often more stable and less volatile than stock markets. In times of economic uncertainty, a well-positioned property can provide a tangible sense of security and peace of mind, which is invaluable in its own right. By considering the appreciation in property value as part of one's overall wealth picture, homeowners can make more informed decisions about their financial future."
t3_p4dk6p,"If a grilled cheese sandwich has anything other than some kind of bread, cheese and buttermayooil, it is no longer a grilled cheese sandwich. I see people all the time call things grilled cheese that aren't and I don't understand it. How the hell is a sandwich with ham, turkey or even brisket a grilled cheese when the primary ingredients are not cheese. Cheese cannot be an after thought or an accent in something something called ""grilled cheese sandwich"" anything other than primary cheese bread and buttermayooil is a sandwich with cheese or some kind of melt. Help me understand this absolute insanity. This is a pretty light hearted CMV and is inspired by the fact that I keep seeing these giant meat filled sandwiches with cheese on them being called things like ""brisket grilled cheese sandwich"" and to me that is a sandwich yes but it shouldn't be called a grilled cheese. Maybe I'm the crazy one but a half pound or pound of meat on bread is just a sandwich even if it has cheese on it.","The argument that a sandwich with cheese but not primarily made from cheese shouldn't be called a grilled cheese overlooks the nuances of culinary terminology. In many contexts, the term ""grilled cheese"" refers more to the cooking method than the specific ingredients involved. Grilling is a technique used to melt and toast bread, often in conjunction with other ingredients like meats or spreads. This technique can be applied to various types of sandwiches, not just those composed primarily of cheese.

Furthermore, language and terminology are inherently subjective and influenced by cultural context. What constitutes a ""grilled cheese"" might vary greatly depending on personal preferences, regional traditions, or even the local culinary scene. It's impossible to pin down an absolute definition that satisfies all culinary experiences. Instead, it's more productive to acknowledge the diversity of interpretations surrounding this dish.

Moreover, the emphasis on strict categorization can lead to unnecessary semantic debates and limitations in creative expression. Chefs and home cooks often experiment with new combinations of ingredients to create innovative dishes that blend different flavors and textures. By dismissing these variations as ""not truly grilled cheese,"" we stifle culinary innovation and overlook the potential for evolution and growth.","The notion that a grilled cheese sandwich can only consist of bread, cheese, and butter or oil is an overly restrictive definition. It fails to account for the diverse cultural and culinary traditions surrounding this dish. Grilled cheese sandwiches have evolved over time, incorporating various ingredients and flavors from different parts of the world. For instance, in some European countries, grilled cheese sandwiches are made with cured meats like ham or prosciutto, which are then grilled alongside the cheese. This combination is not an afterthought, but rather a harmonious union of flavors and textures that enhance the overall experience of the dish.

Moreover, the emphasis on primary ingredients overlooks the role of secondary components in creating a cohesive culinary experience. Cheese, in this case, serves as a binding agent, but it's also elevated by the presence of other ingredients like meats or vegetables. The idea that cheese must be the sole star of the show is an oversimplification of the complexities involved in cooking and flavor profiling.

In many cases, the inclusion of additional ingredients doesn't dilute the essence of the dish; rather, it broadens its appeal and provides a more satisfying experience for consumers. This is particularly relevant when considering regional specialties or cultural interpretations of grilled cheese sandwiches. It's essential to recognize that food is often shaped by local customs, traditions, and ingredient availability, leading to diverse variations that don't necessarily adhere to rigid definitions.","The notion that a half-pound or pound of meat on bread with cheese shouldn't be called a grilled cheese because it's just a sandwich is an overextension of this particular argument. It assumes that sandwiches are fundamentally distinct from other types of dishes, which isn't necessarily true. Many sandwiches incorporate multiple ingredients and flavors that elevate them beyond the sum of their parts.

Moreover, the proliferation of sandwiches as a culinary genre has led to countless variations that blur the lines between traditional categories. A dish like a ""brisket grilled cheese sandwich"" might be seen as an affront to purists who prefer a more rigid definition of grilled cheese. However, it can also be viewed as a creative reinterpretation of this classic dish, incorporating regional flavors and ingredient combinations.

By focusing on the specifics of ingredients or cooking methods, we risk overlooking the broader culinary landscape and the value that diverse interpretations bring to the table. Rather than dismissing these variations as ""not truly grilled cheese,"" we should recognize their potential to enrich our understanding of food and its cultural significance.","The argument that a grilled cheese sandwich must consist of only bread, cheese, and buttermayooil is a narrow definition that neglects the dynamic nature of culinary evolution. In the world of food, ingredients are often combined in innovative ways to create something new and exciting. A brisket grilled cheese sandwich, for example, may seem like a deviation from the original, but it still requires the core elements of a grilled cheese: melted cheese and toasted bread. The addition of brisket adds a rich, smoky flavor that elevates the dish, rather than overpowering it. Similarly, a turkey or ham grilled cheese can add a savory, meaty element that complements the cheese and bread. This is not a case of cheese being an afterthought or an accent, but rather a thoughtful combination of flavors and textures that create a new experience. In fact, the term ""grilled cheese"" is often used as a generic term to describe a broad category of sandwiches, rather than a strict formula. The variations are a testament to the versatility and creativity of the dish. By embracing these adaptations, we can see that the essence of a grilled cheese sandwich lies not in its rigid definition, but in its ability to inspire and satisfy. The brisket grilled cheese, for instance, can be seen as a reflection of the culinary traditions of Texas or the Southern United States, where barbecue is a beloved staple. In this context, the sandwich is not just a fusion of flavors, but a representation of cultural heritage and community. By acknowledging and celebrating these variations, we can foster a more inclusive and diverse culinary landscape.","The notion of a grilled cheese sandwich is not solely defined by its ingredients, but rather by the way it makes people feel and the memories it evokes. When a person takes a bite of a ""brisket grilled cheese sandwich,"" the combination of tender brisket, melted cheese, and crispy bread can transport them back to a summer barbecue or a family gathering. This emotional connection is what truly makes a dish a grilled cheese, not the quantity of cheese or the presence of other ingredients. The author's rigid definition of a grilled cheese sandwich ignores the fact that food is often a catalyst for nostalgia and comfort, and that the addition of brisket or other meats can enhance the emotional resonance of the dish. Furthermore, culinary traditions are often built upon the evolution of existing recipes, and the ""brisket grilled cheese sandwich"" can be seen as a natural progression of the classic grilled cheese. Just as fashion designers update classic silhouettes with new materials and styles, chefs can reimagine the grilled cheese sandwich with different ingredients and techniques. By embracing this creative freedom, the culinary world can stay vibrant and exciting, much like the ever-changing landscape of fashion. The beauty of a ""brisket grilled cheese sandwich"" lies not in its adherence to a strict definition, but in its ability to evoke a sense of wonder and delight in those who try it. Rather than seeing it as an ""insanity,"" the author should celebrate the innovative spirit that leads to the creation of such dishes. By doing so, they can appreciate the artistic expression and culinary craftsmanship that goes into crafting a truly exceptional grilled cheese sandwich, regardless of its ingredients. The author's definition of a grilled cheese sandwich may be simple, but it is not the only truth, and the world of food is richer for its diversity and complexity.","The notion that a grilled cheese sandwich can only consist of bread, cheese, and a spread is a narrow and limited interpretation that neglects the rich diversity of culinary traditions around the world. In many cultures, grilled cheese sandwiches are not just about the primary ingredients, but about the cultural context and the art of combining flavors and textures. For example, in some parts of Latin America, tortas de queso are a staple, consisting of melted cheese, meats, and various toppings served on a crusty bread. These sandwiches may not conform to the traditionalist's definition, but they are undoubtedly grilled cheese sandwiches in the eyes of the people who make and enjoy them.

Furthermore, the argument that adding meat or other ingredients makes a sandwich no longer a grilled cheese is arbitrary and subjective. A grilled cheese sandwich is not defined by its ingredients alone, but by the method of preparation and the cultural significance it holds. In many cases, the addition of meat or other ingredients enhances the overall experience of the grilled cheese, rather than detracting from it. Consider the Italian panino, which typically consists of a grilled cheese sandwich filled with cured meats, vegetables, and spreads. Is it not still a grilled cheese, despite the added complexity of flavors and textures?

The emphasis on primary ingredients and strict definitions overlooks the evolution of culinary traditions and the creativity of chefs and home cooks. As food culture becomes increasingly globalized, it's essential to acknowledge and celebrate the diverse ways in which people prepare and enjoy grilled cheese sandwiches. By imposing a rigid definition, the traditionalist's worldview risks stifling innovation and creativity in the culinary world. Instead, a more open-minded approach would allow for a richer understanding and appreciation of the many variations of grilled cheese sandwiches that exist around the world."
t3_xs6lnj,"If there were no animal protection laws, most mammal species would be extinct in the U.S.. Given the amount of guns in the U.S. and the lack of things to legally shoot and kill, I believe if we did away with laws preventing shooting animals in residentialurban areas, and hunting at certain times and only certain animals, deer would be extinct, rabbits would be extinct, foxes would be extinct, etc. If there were no laws to prevent shooting your gun in an urban, suburban, or rural area, people wouldn't just shoot anything, though. Shooting other people's property would have repercussions. But with no law to prevent shooting as many bears as you want, whenever you want, for example, people would hunt them to extinction in the U.S.","A more nuanced view of human behavior is necessary when considering the impact of removing animal protection laws. While some individuals might engage in reckless hunting practices, many others would find alternative outlets for their passions and skills. For example, birdwatching and wildlife photography have become increasingly popular hobbies, providing opportunities for people to appreciate nature without contributing to species decline.

In addition, the idea that unrestricted hunting would lead to extinction neglects the role of environmental factors such as habitat loss, climate change, and disease in shaping population dynamics. These broader issues often pose far greater threats to mammal populations than hunting itself. By addressing these underlying challenges through conservation efforts and ecosystem management, it is possible to create a more sustainable future for wildlife.

The notion that humans would inevitably resort to destructive behavior without regulations overlooks the complex relationships between human communities, cultures, and environments. Many indigenous groups have long practiced subsistence hunting and gathering in harmony with their ecosystems, demonstrating that responsible resource use can coexist with thriving natural populations. By learning from these examples and adopting more holistic approaches to conservation, it is possible to create a future where wildlife thrives alongside human activity.","The argument for animal protection laws relies on a simplistic view of human decision-making, assuming that individuals would automatically engage in destructive behavior without regulations. However, this perspective neglects the importance of social norms, community values, and economic incentives in shaping human choices.

For instance, studies have shown that hunters who adopt sustainable practices often do so because they value the recreational experience, the thrill of the hunt, and the connection with nature. These motivations are not necessarily driven by a desire to harm animals but rather to participate in a tradition that respects and honors the natural world. Furthermore, many hunting communities already engage in self-regulation through organizations like the Boone and Crockett Club, which promote responsible hunting practices and conservation efforts.

In addition, removing regulations might actually increase support for wildlife conservation among hunters, as they would be able to contribute directly to species management and habitat preservation. This could lead to a more collaborative approach between hunters, conservationists, and policymakers, fostering a shared commitment to preserving biodiversity. By acknowledging the complexities of human decision-making and the diversity of motivations driving hunting practices, it is possible to create a more inclusive and effective framework for wildlife conservation.","The assertion that animal protection laws are necessary to prevent mammal species from becoming extinct in the U.S. relies on a flawed assumption about human behavior when faced with unrestricted hunting and shooting of wildlife. While it is true that some individuals might exploit the lack of regulations, it neglects the fact that many others would adopt more sustainable and responsible practices. For instance, some hunters already engage in selective culling to maintain healthy populations and ensure biodiversity, demonstrating that self-regulation can be an effective means of managing wildlife resources.

In addition, removing restrictions on hunting and shooting might actually lead to a decrease in poaching, as regulated hunting areas would become more appealing to those seeking to hunt legally. This shift could reduce pressure on endangered species, allowing conservation efforts to focus on preserving habitats and ecosystems rather than addressing the consequences of overhunting. Furthermore, education and outreach programs can help raise awareness among hunters about responsible wildlife management practices.

Moreover, some countries with relaxed hunting regulations have not seen a decline in mammal populations. In fact, countries like Sweden and Finland have successfully implemented policies that allow for sustainable hunting practices, resulting in healthy deer and moose populations. By adopting similar approaches, the U.S. could create an environment where responsible hunting contributes to conservation rather than extinction.","The notion that removing animal protection laws would lead to the extinction of many mammal species in the United States is a dramatic and alarmist scenario that fails to account for the complexities of human behavior and the intricacies of the human-wildlife relationship. In reality, most people value coexistence with wildlife and are not motivated by the desire to hunt to extinction. Furthermore, the existence of animal protection laws and hunting regulations is not solely based on the fear of extinction, but also on the recognition of the importance of balancing human and wildlife needs. By implementing regulations that promote sustainable hunting practices, we can ensure that wildlife populations remain healthy and robust while also allowing for controlled hunting and the economic benefits it provides.

Moreover, a more nuanced approach would recognize that human behavior is shaped by a multitude of factors, including education, cultural background, and personal experiences. In areas where hunting is an integral part of the local culture, for instance, removing regulations might actually promote a greater sense of respect and stewardship for wildlife, rather than reckless hunting. In fact, many communities have successfully implemented hunting programs that emphasize the importance of conservation and responsible hunting practices, demonstrating that humans are capable of balancing their needs with those of the wildlife.

Additionally, the assumption that people would shoot anything they want without laws to prevent it is an oversimplification of human nature. Most people are not driven by a desire to harm wildlife, but rather by a desire to provide for their families and communities. By engaging with wildlife and learning about the importance of conservation, individuals can develop a deeper appreciation for the natural world and a sense of responsibility to protect it. In contrast, simply removing regulations would likely lead to a breakdown in trust between humans and wildlife, as well as a lack of education and understanding about the importance of conservation.

Ultimately, the solution to promoting coexistence between humans and wildlife lies not in removing regulations, but in engaging people in meaningful ways, providing education and resources to promote responsible hunting and conservation practices, and fostering a deeper understanding of the importance of wildlife conservation. By taking a more nuanced and multifaceted approach, we can work towards a future where humans and wildlife thrive together, rather than resorting to drastic and ineffective measures like removing animal protection laws.","The notion that removing animal protection laws would lead to the extinction of most mammal species in the U.S. is based on a simplistic understanding of human-wildlife interactions. In reality, the relationship between human settlements and wildlife is far more complex than the dichotomy of ""protected"" vs. ""unprotected"" areas. For instance, human settlements often overlap with wildlife habitats, and the presence of animals in urban and suburban areas is a natural consequence of habitat fragmentation and human expansion. In many cases, animals are not merely passive victims of hunting but rather, they are actively adapting to their environments, finding ways to coexist with humans, and even benefiting from human presence.

Moreover, the idea that removing laws would lead to a free-for-all hunting spree is not supported by empirical evidence. In fact, most people who engage in hunting do so responsibly, adhering to local regulations and respecting the animals and their habitats. Moreover, many hunting practices, such as bear hunting, are often regulated by local authorities to ensure sustainable populations and prevent overhunting. It is also worth noting that the lack of laws would not necessarily lead to an increase in hunting, as many people may choose not to hunt due to personal or cultural reasons.

Furthermore, the geology and topography of the U.S. play a significant role in shaping human-wildlife interactions. Mountain ranges, forests, and waterways create corridors and barriers that affect animal migration patterns, habitat fragmentation, and human-wildlife conflicts. Removing laws would not address the underlying geographical factors that contribute to these conflicts, and it would likely lead to further environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity. A more effective approach would be to integrate animal protection laws with habitat preservation, education, and community involvement, recognizing the interconnectedness of ecosystems and the need for holistic conservation strategies.","While it is true that the removal of animal protection laws could lead to overhunting of certain mammal species in the United States, the consequences of such a policy would be far more catastrophic and far-reaching than the author suggests. A lack of regulation would not only threaten the populations of deer, rabbits, and foxes, but also have a ripple effect throughout entire ecosystems. For instance, the removal of apex predators such as bears, wolves, and mountain lions would lead to a surge in prey populations, resulting in overgrazing and degradation of habitats. This, in turn, would have devastating effects on plant species and other wildlife that depend on these ecosystems, ultimately threatening the very fabric of the ecosystem.

Moreover, the author's assertion that people would not shoot other people's property due to repercussions is overly optimistic. In reality, the absence of regulations would lead to a culture of impunity, where individuals would feel emboldened to hunt and kill wildlife with impunity, regardless of the consequences. The author's assumption that people would respect private property is also naive, as the removal of regulations would likely lead to a surge in poaching and wildlife trafficking, further exacerbating the problem.

Furthermore, the author's focus on mammal populations overlooks the many species that are not subject to hunting regulations, such as birds, reptiles, and amphibians. The removal of animal protection laws would put these species at even greater risk of extinction, as they would become easy prey for hunters and collectors. It is also worth noting that many indigenous communities rely on sustainable hunting practices as a means of subsistence, and the removal of regulations would undermine their ability to manage their own resources and practice their traditional ways of life.

In addition, the author's argument relies on a simplistic view of human behavior, assuming that individuals would hunt responsibly and only target specific species. However, human behavior is far more complex, and the removal of regulations would likely lead to a culture of reckless hunting, where individuals would target any species they deem desirable, regardless of the consequences. In conclusion, the removal of animal protection laws would have far-reaching and devastating consequences for ecosystems, wildlife, and human communities, and would ultimately undermine conservation efforts and exacerbate the extinction crisis."
t3_td2w6r,"Children should not get Baptized or recieve religious teaching until they are old enough to consent. I am an atheist and happily married to a Catholic woman. We have a six months old Daughter and for the first time in our relationship religion is becoming a point of tension between us. My wife wants our daughter be baptized and raised as a Christian. According to her it is good for her to be told this and it helps with building morality furthermore it is part of Western culture. In my view I don't want my daughter to be indoctrinated into any religion. If she makes the conscious decision to join the church when she is old enough to think about it herself that is OK. But I want her to be able to develop her own character first. ---edit---
As this has been brought up multiple times before in the thread I want to address it once. Yes we should have talked about that before. We were aware of each other's views and we agreed that a discussion needs to be happening soon. But we both new we want a child regardless of that decision. And the past times where stressful for everyone so we kept delaying that talk. But it still needs to happen. This is why I ask strangers on the Internet to prepare for that discussion to see every possible argument for and against it.","The argument against baptizing or teaching children about religion until they are older relies heavily on the assumption that faith is merely a personal preference, rather than an integral part of human existence. However, for many people, faith is not just a choice but a fundamental aspect of their identity and worldview. It provides a framework for understanding the world and one's place within it, as well as a sense of purpose and belonging. By delaying exposure to religious teachings, children may miss out on valuable opportunities for spiritual growth and development that can shape their values and character in profound ways. Moreover, the idea that children should be shielded from faith until they are older implies that it is somehow fragile or vulnerable to harm, rather than a robust and resilient part of human experience. In reality, exposure to diverse perspectives and traditions can foster tolerance, empathy, and critical thinking skills, all of which are essential for navigating an increasingly complex and interconnected world.","The assumption that children are not capable of making informed decisions about their religious upbringing until they are older is a narrow and overly pessimistic view. It underestimates the capacity for children to form opinions and affiliations with various belief systems, even at a young age. In fact, many children begin asking questions about faith and morality as early as preschool, demonstrating an innate curiosity that cannot be suppressed by delayed exposure. Furthermore, the notion that waiting until they are older will allow them to develop their own character is based on the flawed premise that moral development is solely the result of individual effort and not shaped by environmental factors, including family and community influences. Research has shown that children who grow up in families with a consistent spiritual practice tend to exhibit better social-emotional skills and more empathy towards others. Allowing children to explore their faith from an early age can foster a sense of belonging and community, which is essential for healthy development. It is also worth noting that baptism is not simply a matter of indoctrination; it can be a meaningful ritual that provides a sense of identity and connection to tradition.","The notion that children should only be baptized or taught about religion when they are able to give informed consent overlooks the fact that many people's faith is not solely a matter of individual choice but also a social and cultural inheritance. For many families, faith is a central part of their heritage and identity, passed down through generations as a rich tapestry of tradition and practice. Delaying exposure to religious teachings may deprive children of this vital connection to their community and cultural roots. Furthermore, the assumption that children are not capable of making informed decisions about their faith until they are older relies on an overly simplistic view of human development. In reality, children's capacity for decision-making is complex and multifaceted, influenced by a range of cognitive, social, and emotional factors. By engaging with children in conversations about faith from an early age, parents can foster their critical thinking skills, promote autonomy and agency, and help them develop a robust and nuanced understanding of the world around them.","The notion that a child should only be baptized or taught a faith once they are old enough to consent may seem like a reasonable approach, but it overlooks the significance of cultural heritage and family ties. In many Western societies, baptism is an integral part of cultural identity, a way of connecting with one's community and understanding the traditions that have shaped the family's history. By denying a child this experience, parents may inadvertently create a sense of disconnection from their own roots and the values that have been passed down through generations. This is not about indoctrination, but about providing a child with a sense of belonging and shared understanding of the world.

Moreover, the idea that a child must wait until they are old enough to make an informed decision about their faith ignores the fact that children are not a blank slate. From a young age, they are influenced by their environment, their parents, and their community, and baptism and religious teaching can be a natural part of this process. It is not about forcing a particular set of beliefs on a child, but about introducing them to the cultural and spiritual traditions that have shaped their family's history.

In a mixed-faith household like the author's, it's particularly important to find ways to balance different values and traditions. Baptism can be a meaningful way to bridge the gap between two different faiths, creating a sense of unity and shared identity. By participating in this ritual, a child can begin to understand and appreciate the diversity of their family's cultural heritage, rather than feeling like they are caught between two conflicting identities.

Ultimately, the decision to baptize a child or teach them a faith is not about forcing a particular set of beliefs on them, but about providing them with a rich and diverse cultural context in which to grow and learn. By embracing their cultural heritage, children can develop a strong sense of self and a deeper understanding of the world around them.","The notion that children should not be baptized or receive religious teachings until they are old enough to consent is a well-intentioned attempt to ensure their autonomy and intellectual freedom. However, it may inadvertently overlook the significance of religious identity in shaping an individual's sense of belonging and community. The desire for children to develop their own character and make informed decisions about their faith is admirable, but it is also essential to acknowledge the role of social and cultural contexts in shaping their worldview. In many Western societies, Christianity is deeply embedded in cultural practices and traditions, and participating in these rituals can be a meaningful way for children to connect with their heritage and community.

Moreover, the idea that children should only be introduced to religion when they are mature enough to make informed decisions ignores the fact that children are already surrounded by religious messages and symbols in their daily lives. They are exposed to various cultural and social norms, including those related to faith, which can influence their perceptions and attitudes. By delaying the introduction of religious teachings, parents may inadvertently create a void in their child's understanding of these cultural contexts, potentially leading to confusion and disconnection from their community.

Furthermore, the assumption that children are blank slates, devoid of any preconceived notions or biases, is unrealistic. Children are born into a world that is already imbued with cultural, social, and religious norms, and it is impossible to completely shield them from these influences. By engaging with their child's spiritual curiosity and providing a nuanced understanding of different faith traditions, parents can empower their child to make informed decisions about their own spiritual path.

Ultimately, the goal of parenting should not be to prevent children from making their own decisions but to equip them with the knowledge, critical thinking skills, and emotional intelligence to navigate the complexities of life. By involving children in conversations about faith and spirituality from an early age, parents can foster a deeper understanding of the world and their place within it, allowing them to make more informed choices about their own spiritual journeys.","The notion that children should not receive religious teachings until they are old enough to consent is a noble attempt to safeguard against indoctrination, but it may overlook the complex interplay between family, culture, and personal identity. A child's exposure to a faith community can serve as a vital foundation for their emotional and social development, providing a sense of belonging and connection to a broader tradition. This is not to say that children should be pressured or forced to conform, but rather that they should be offered a rich and nuanced exploration of their family's cultural heritage, allowing them to engage with the values and practices that have been passed down through generations. By doing so, children can develop a deeper understanding of their place within the world and cultivate a sense of empathy and compassion that is essential for building strong relationships.

Moreover, research has shown that early exposure to a faith community can have a profound impact on a child's emotional intelligence, social skills, and moral development. Studies have demonstrated that children who participate in faith-based activities tend to exhibit higher levels of empathy, cooperation, and self-awareness, all of which are essential for building strong, resilient relationships. Furthermore, the sense of community and belonging that comes with being part of a faith community can provide a child with a sense of security and support, which is critical for their overall well-being.

It is also worth considering the cultural context in which this decision is being made. In Western societies, Christianity is deeply ingrained in the cultural fabric, and many people, regardless of their personal beliefs, identify with certain aspects of the faith tradition. By exposing their child to this cultural heritage, parents are not necessarily indoctrinating them with a set of rigid dogma, but rather providing them with a rich and complex understanding of the world around them. This allows children to develop a sense of cultural literacy and appreciation for the diversity of human experience, which is essential for building bridges between different communities and fostering greater understanding.

Ultimately, the decision to expose children to religious teachings should not be seen as a zero-sum game, where one parent's values and desires must be prioritized over the other's. Rather, it should be viewed as an opportunity for both parents to engage in a thoughtful and nuanced discussion about their values, traditions, and cultural heritage. By working together, they can create a rich and inclusive environment that allows their child to explore and develop their own sense of identity, free from the constraints of rigid dogma or expectation."
t3_ad6pcy,"Capitalism is Welfare for the Rich 1. Capital is the means of production. 2. Capitalism is private ownership of the means of production. The owners are called Capitalists. 3. Capitalists generate money by only allowing laborers who will give them a portion of the proceeds of their labor to use the capital. 4. In this way, capital generates money for its owner just by being an owner, and not through any productive labor. 5. Capitalists are often richer than other citizens, because they can make money from their labor and make money from owning capital. 6. Money generated by ownership is a form of economic entitlement. 7. The ownership of capital is protected by the government (the police, the military, and the legal system), so the money generated by capital is a government-backed economic entitlement. 8. Government-backed economic entitlements are called welfare. 9. Capitalism is welfare for the rich. Corollary: Capitalists are not productive members of society, insofar as they are capitalists. I'm open to the idea that Capitalists might actually provide value to society, but since any actual work capitalists do can usually be delegated to a laborer, I have trouble seeing it.  the CMV moderators.","The argument that capitalism is welfare for the rich fails to account for the vast array of individuals who are not capitalists, yet still drive economic growth and innovation. Consider the talented individuals who excel in their fields, from scientists and engineers to artists and writers. These individuals generate wealth and create value through their skills and hard work, yet they are not necessarily capitalists. They may work for a company, start their own business, or work as freelancers, but they are not owners of the means of production. Instead, they are the ones who bring ideas to life, who take risks, and who push the boundaries of what is possible. Their contributions are invaluable, and their success is a testament to the power of individual talent and effort. In fact, many successful entrepreneurs and business leaders are not simply born with wealth, but rather have worked tirelessly to develop their skills and build their careers. They are the ones who are creating value, driving innovation, and generating wealth, rather than simply relying on their ownership of capital. The idea that capitalists are the only ones who contribute to the economy is a narrow and misleading view. Furthermore, the notion that ownership of capital is a form of economic entitlement, protected by the government, is an oversimplification of the complex relationships between individuals, businesses, and the state. In reality, businesses and governments often have competing interests, and the notion of government-backed economic entitlements is a simplification of a far more nuanced system. By ignoring the agency and contributions of non-capitalist individuals, the argument that capitalism is welfare for the rich fails to capture the full complexity of economic reality.","The notion that capitalism is welfare for the rich oversimplifies the complexities of economic systems and ignores the agency of individuals in achieving success. While it is true that wealth inequality is a pressing issue in many capitalist systems, labeling capitalists' earnings as a form of welfare overlooks the fact that many successful entrepreneurs and business owners have worked tirelessly to build their businesses from the ground up. The accumulation of wealth and capital often requires significant risk-taking, innovation, and strategic decision-making, which cannot be reduced to a simplistic notion of welfare. Furthermore, social capital, or the networks and connections that facilitate economic exchange, plays a crucial role in enabling individuals to access resources, information, and opportunities that can lead to economic success. This social capital can be cultivated through education, social connections, and community engagement, and can be a powerful determinant of economic outcomes.

Moreover, the idea that capitalists are not productive members of society is based on a narrow definition of productivity that neglects the value of entrepreneurship and innovation. Entrepreneurs often bring new ideas, products, and services to market, creating jobs, stimulating economic growth, and driving innovation. While it is true that some capitalists may delegate tasks to laborers, this does not necessarily mean that they are not contributing to the economy. In fact, the very existence of laborers and the goods and services they produce are dependent on the demand generated by capitalists. The symbiotic relationship between capitalists and laborers is a fundamental aspect of capitalist economies, and it is disingenuous to portray one side as parasitic and the other as productive.

Ultimately, the label of ""welfare for the rich"" is a misleading oversimplification that obscures the complexities of economic systems and the agency of individuals. By acknowledging the role of social capital, entrepreneurship, and innovation, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of how wealth is accumulated and how it can be used to benefit society as a whole. Rather than pitting capitalists against laborers, we should focus on creating a more equitable and inclusive economic system that rewards hard work, innovation, and entrepreneurship, while also addressing the pressing issue of wealth inequality.","While it's true that capitalism has been criticized for creating vast economic inequalities, it's essential to recognize that individual agency and personal drive play a significant role in shaping economic outcomes. Many successful entrepreneurs and business owners have overcome significant obstacles to build successful enterprises, driven by their passions, skills, and determination. These individuals often contribute significantly to their communities, creating jobs, innovation, and economic growth that benefits a wide range of people. Moreover, the idea that capitalists are not productive members of society is an oversimplification, as many business owners and investors are indeed innovative and creative problem-solvers who generate new products, services, and ideas that improve people's lives.

Furthermore, the focus on government-backed economic entitlements as a key characteristic of capitalism overlooks the fact that many entrepreneurs and small business owners rely on their own hard work and risk-taking to achieve success, rather than solely relying on government support. The narrative that capitalists are simply ""lucky"" or that their wealth is solely a result of their ownership of capital, neglects the countless hours, sweat, and tears invested by entrepreneurs in building and growing their businesses. Additionally, the notion that capitalists are inherently privileged or entitled to their wealth ignores the fact that many successful business owners have faced significant challenges and setbacks along the way, including financial risks, market uncertainty, and personal sacrifices.

A more nuanced understanding of capitalism recognizes that individual agency and entrepreneurship can be a powerful force for economic growth and social mobility. By highlighting the stories of successful entrepreneurs and business owners, we can better understand the complexities of human motivation and the ways in which people interact with and adapt to the capitalist system. This perspective also acknowledges the diversity of experiences within the capitalist system, including the many individuals and communities who have created successful businesses and achieved economic prosperity through hard work, determination, and innovation.","The argument that capitalism is welfare for the rich relies heavily on a narrow definition of ""work"" and ""productivity."" However, this overlooks the crucial role entrepreneurs play in driving innovation and creating new jobs. By taking calculated risks and investing in new ideas, capitalists often create opportunities for laborers to find employment and contribute to the economy. Furthermore, the notion that capitalists only make money by allowing others to use their capital is an oversimplification of the complex relationships between owners and employees. In reality, many business leaders are deeply involved in the day-to-day operations of their companies and make crucial decisions about resource allocation, marketing strategies, and product development. These activities require a high level of expertise, dedication, and hard work, which cannot be easily delegated to others. Moreover, entrepreneurs often must navigate complex regulatory environments, negotiate with suppliers and customers, and manage risks in order to generate returns on their investments. By doing so, they create value not only for themselves but also for the broader economy.","The argument that capitalism is welfare for the rich relies on a flawed assumption about the nature of economic entitlements. While it is true that capital owners receive returns on their investments, this does not necessarily mean they are entitled to these benefits simply by virtue of ownership. In reality, the value created by capitalists is often contingent upon their ability to innovate and adapt in response to changing market conditions. Moreover, the return on investment can be seen as a reflection of risk-taking rather than mere entitlement. By taking on risks that others may not be willing or able to assume, entrepreneurs create opportunities for growth and development that benefit both themselves and society at large. This perspective highlights the complexities involved in understanding the relationship between capital ownership, economic returns, and social value.","The corollary that capitalists are unproductive members of society overlooks the fact that entrepreneurs often provide essential services that benefit society as a whole. For instance, tech companies like Google and Facebook have revolutionized communication and access to information, while pharmaceutical companies develop life-saving treatments and vaccines. These innovations would not be possible without the investment and risk-taking of capitalists. Furthermore, many businesses contribute significantly to their local communities through philanthropy and social responsibility initiatives. This is often overlooked in favor of a simplistic portrayal of capitalists as parasitic exploiters. In reality, the creation of wealth under capitalism involves a delicate balance between individual entrepreneurship and collective well-being."
t3_28sivx,"I see no reason why men's and women's chess are separate events. Sure, sex segregation makes a lot of sense for many sportsgames where men might have an advantage due to physiological differences. But chess is purely mental. There is no need for strength, speed, endurance or any other physiological parameter that would give men an advantage. In fact, some women do compete successfully in top flight tournaments with men, something that would be impossible in physical sports. If anything, it seems that ""women only"" chess events are sexist, because the implication is that women are not as smart as men. Edit:
The totality of several posts convinced me that women only events maybe needed for now as a kind of a remedial measure for countering many years of men dominance in chess and the fact that currently women are underrepresented in chess. However, I still believe that an eventual goal should be complete sex equality in chess tournaments.","The argument that women-only events are sexist because they imply that women are less smart than men oversimplifies the complexities of sex segregation in sports and competitions. Sex-segregated events can serve as a means to increase female participation and representation, rather than an acknowledgment of inherent differences in cognitive abilities. By providing opportunities for women to compete against each other without the pressure and distraction of male opponents, these events can help build confidence, experience, and networks among female players. This can have long-term benefits for gender equality in chess, as it fosters a more inclusive environment where women feel empowered to participate and succeed on their own terms.","The assumption that chess is purely mental overlooks the complex interplay between cognitive and physiological factors in competitive performance. While it is true that physical attributes may not be a direct advantage in chess, they can significantly influence an individual's ability to focus, concentrate, and manage stress over extended periods. Hormonal fluctuations, for instance, can impact mood and emotional regulation, which are critical components of mental performance under pressure. Furthermore, research has shown that women often exhibit different cognitive strategies and thought processes than men, which may be less effective in the competitive chess environment. This does not imply a deficit in intelligence or ability but rather a difference in approach and experience. The existence of successful female players who compete against men does not negate these underlying differences; it merely highlights the exceptional talents of those individuals.","The notion that separate men's and women's chess events are necessary only until women become more represented in the sport overlooks the broader implications of this approach. By delaying equal participation opportunities until there is parity, you risk perpetuating a culture where women are seen as less capable or less deserving of competition against their male counterparts. This can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, where women's abilities are measured by their performance in segregated events rather than on an equal footing with men. Moreover, the idea that women need remedial measures to counter years of male dominance overlooks the contributions and achievements of female players throughout chess history. By acknowledging these past accomplishments and recognizing the value of diversity in the game, you can work towards creating a more inclusive environment where everyone has an equal chance to succeed.","While it's understandable to appreciate the intellectual nature of chess and the potential for equal competition among men and women, the issue of sexism in chess is far more complex than a simple matter of physical differences versus mental abilities. The history of chess has been marked by patriarchal norms and biases that have discouraged women from participating in the sport, often perpetuating stereotypes about women's capabilities and interests. Women who have excelled in chess have often faced obstacles such as lack of access to resources, inadequate support, and subtle forms of sexism that can erode their confidence and commitment to the game. By ignoring these factors, the argument for abandoning women's chess events overlooks the very real challenges that women face in a predominantly male-dominated field.

Moreover, the argument that women-only chess events are sexist because they imply women are not as smart as men oversimplifies the issue and neglects the value of creating a safe and supportive environment for women to develop their skills. Separate events can provide a platform for women to compete and learn without facing the kind of marginalization and exclusion that can be inherent in mixed-gender events. This is not about suggesting that women are inherently less capable than men, but rather about acknowledging the reality of the power dynamics at play and taking steps to level the playing field. In fact, women-only events have been instrumental in fostering a sense of community and camaraderie among women chess players, helping to build their confidence and motivation to continue playing.

Furthermore, the argument that women-only events are only necessary as a ""remedial measure"" for countering men's dominance in chess overlooks the significance of these events as a means of empowerment and social change. By providing a platform for women to compete and succeed on their own terms, women-only events can help challenge the patriarchal norms and biases that have historically excluded women from the sport. This is not a question of simply ""fixing"" the problem of women's underrepresentation, but rather about creating a more inclusive and equitable environment that values the contributions and achievements of women in chess.","While the author's assertion that chess is a purely mental game and that sex segregation is unnecessary is understandable, it overlooks the broader social and cultural context in which women's participation in chess is situated. Research has shown that women and girls often face significant barriers to entry in male-dominated fields, including intimidation, marginalization, and exclusion. In such an environment, segregated events can serve as a vital lifeline for women and girls who might otherwise feel discouraged from participating. Moreover, the idea that women's chess events are inherently sexist implies that women are incapable of competing with men on an equal footing, which is a pernicious stereotype that has been perpetuated throughout history.

Furthermore, the assumption that women's chess events are necessary only as a ""remedial measure"" for countering years of male dominance oversimplifies the complex power dynamics at play. The fact that women are underrepresented in chess is a symptom of a broader societal issue, one that requires a multifaceted solution. By focusing solely on individual achievement, the author's proposal ignores the systemic barriers that prevent women from accessing the same opportunities as men. In reality, segregated events can provide a safe and supportive environment for women to develop their skills, build their confidence, and gain the experience and exposure necessary to compete at the highest levels.

Moreover, the author's emphasis on complete sex equality in chess tournaments overlooks the importance of intersectionality and the experiences of women of color, queer women, and women with disabilities, who may face even greater barriers to entry and participation. By recognizing and addressing these differences, segregated events can help to create a more inclusive and equitable chess community that values diversity and promotes equal opportunities for all. In conclusion, while the author's intention to promote equality is commendable, a more nuanced approach that acknowledges the complexities of power and inequality is necessary to create a truly inclusive and equitable chess environment.","While the idea of sex equality in chess tournaments may seem like a straightforward solution, it overlooks the historical context and the current state of women's participation in the game. The fact that women have been historically underrepresented in chess, and continue to be so, suggests that a more nuanced approach is needed. Creating separate events for women, at least in the short term, can serve as a vital stepping stone for those who have been excluded or marginalized from the predominantly male-dominated chess community. It allows women to gain experience, build confidence, and develop a sense of belonging within a safe and supportive environment.

Furthermore, this targeted approach acknowledges that women's chess has a unique set of challenges, including the need for role models, mentors, and access to resources that are often lacking in traditional chess settings. Separate events provide a platform for women to showcase their talents, engage with one another, and draw attention to their achievements. This, in turn, can help to break down stereotypes and challenge the notion that women are inherently less capable than men in chess. By supporting women's chess events, we can help to create a more inclusive and equitable environment that benefits everyone involved.

In the long term, the goal of complete sex equality in chess tournaments is indeed laudable, but it requires a more comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic and structural barriers that have contributed to the underrepresentation of women. Separate events can be a crucial part of this process, providing a foundation for growth, development, and increased participation. By acknowledging the value of targeted support, we can work towards a future where women and men have equal opportunities to excel in chess, free from the constraints of historical and systemic inequality."
t3_8gmxsf,"Social justice is making racial segregation worse, not better. Social justice warriors (SJWs) more frequently tell other people ""you must do X because you're race Y"" or ""you can't do X because you're race Y"" so much. For example:
""You can't disagree with people of color about racism because you're white""
""You can't wear a Chinese dress to prom because you're white"" (yes, this post is about that issue)
""If you're asian you must be offended by white people having asian fetishes""
""You must wear an afro because you're black, otherwise you're trying to be white"" (example)
""You can't marry white people if you're black"" (example)
If we want equality we need to stop this kind of thinking. racial equality means that everyone, regardless of race, should be equally allowed to discuss racial issues, equally allowed to wear chinese dresses, equally allowed to love whoever they want, equally allowed to cosplay any character, equally allowed to marry anyone regardless of race. The social justice movement, on the other hand, does the exact opposite. They impose boundaries and limitations on what people are allowed to do based on their race. This is not fair, and cannot be allowed if we want to strive for equality. To limit what people can do because of their race makes them feel alienated and not welcome. This deepens racial divides. To change my view, there is one thing you need to do: Give one example of when modern (post-2010) social justice activism has decreased the amount of segregation - where a certain race was previously not allowed to do something because of their race, but through social justice activism, are now allowed to do. This is not the only way to change my view, but it is my best suggestion for you.","The argument that social justice is making racial segregation worse by imposing boundaries and limitations on what people can do based on their race ignores the power dynamics at play in these interactions. When white individuals are told that they cannot wear a Chinese dress or have an Asian fetish, it is not because of arbitrary restrictions, but rather because of the historical context of cultural appropriation and racism. The issue is not about limiting individual freedom, but rather about recognizing the impact of one's actions on marginalized communities.

Moreover, social justice activism is not about restricting people's choices, but rather about promoting greater awareness and understanding of power dynamics. By acknowledging the historical and ongoing impacts of colonialism, slavery, and racism, we can begin to address the systemic inequalities that have been perpetuated through cultural appropriation and other forms of racialized oppression.

Furthermore, the examples cited in the original argument are not isolated incidents, but rather part of a broader pattern of racial insensitivity and disrespect. When individuals from dominant groups ignore or dismiss the feelings and concerns of marginalized communities, it is not because they are being restricted, but rather because they are exercising their privilege without regard for others.

By promoting greater awareness and understanding of these power dynamics, social justice activism can help to create a more inclusive and equitable society, where everyone has the opportunity to participate fully and equally. Rather than seeing social justice as a restriction on individual freedom, we should recognize its potential to promote greater empathy, understanding, and respect for marginalized communities.","The argument that social justice is making racial segregation worse by imposing boundaries and limitations on what people can do based on their race misunderstands the concept of intersectionality. Social justice warriors are not advocating for a zero-sum game where one group's gain must come at the expense of another. Rather, they are pushing for a more nuanced understanding of how different forms of oppression intersect and impact individuals and communities.

Moreover, social justice activism is not about imposing boundaries or limitations on individual freedom, but rather about promoting greater awareness and understanding of the historical and ongoing impacts of systemic racism and other forms of oppression. By acknowledging these intersections, we can begin to address the complex ways in which racism and other forms of oppression are perpetuated through cultural norms, institutions, and policies.

For instance, the debate around cultural appropriation highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of power dynamics and cultural exchange. When individuals from dominant groups appropriate cultural symbols or practices without proper understanding or respect, it is not because they are being restricted, but rather because they are exercising their privilege without regard for others. By promoting greater awareness and understanding of these issues, social justice activism can help to create a more inclusive and equitable society, where everyone has the opportunity to participate fully and equally.

Rather than dismissing social justice as counterproductive, it is essential to acknowledge its contributions to promoting greater equality and inclusivity in society. By examining the complexities of intersectionality and power dynamics, we can begin to appreciate the nuanced role that social justice plays in challenging racial segregation and promoting a more just and equitable society.","The argument that social justice is making racial segregation worse by imposing boundaries and limitations on what people can do based on their race overlooks the complex historical context of systemic racism. Social justice warriors are not advocating for arbitrary restrictions, but rather, they are pushing against centuries-old norms that have been used to exclude marginalized communities from equal participation in society. The examples cited, such as wearing a Chinese dress or loving whoever one wants, are attempts to rectify these injustices and promote inclusivity. By focusing solely on the ""cannot"" statements, the original argument ignores the broader narrative of social justice activism, which seeks to dismantle systemic barriers that have perpetuated racial segregation.

Moreover, the notion that social justice activism is ineffective because it cannot provide a single example of decreased segregation misunderstands the nature of social change. Social movements often operate in subtle and incremental ways, challenging entrenched power structures through education, awareness-raising, and community engagement. The impact of social justice activism may not always be immediately measurable or quantifiable, but its long-term effects can be profound.

In reality, social justice activism has played a crucial role in shifting cultural attitudes and promoting greater understanding and acceptance of marginalized communities. For instance, the Black Lives Matter movement has helped to draw attention to police brutality and systemic racism, sparking national conversations about racial injustice. Similarly, LGBTQ rights activists have worked tirelessly to secure equal rights and protections for individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.

Rather than dismissing social justice activism as counterproductive, it is essential to acknowledge its contributions to promoting greater equality and inclusivity in society. By examining the broader historical context and understanding the complexities of social change, we can begin to appreciate the nuanced role that social justice plays in challenging racial segregation and promoting a more just and equitable society.","The assertion that social justice activism is making racial segregation worse is a mischaracterization of the movement's goals and objectives. Social justice warriors, as you call them, are not seeking to impose restrictions on individuals, but rather to highlight the ways in which societal norms and institutions perpetuate systemic inequalities. The examples you provided, such as requiring individuals to wear certain hairstyles or prohibiting interracial relationships, are often taken out of context and do not represent the complexity of the issues at hand. In reality, social justice activism seeks to challenge these norms and create a more inclusive and equitable society.

Moreover, it is disingenuous to suggest that social justice activism has not contributed to reducing segregation. For instance, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed segregation in public accommodations, was a direct result of social justice activism. The movement for women's suffrage, which fought for women's right to vote, was also a social justice movement that challenged societal norms and achieved significant gains. The struggle for LGBTQ rights, which has led to greater acceptance and recognition of diverse identities, is another example of social justice activism bridging divides and promoting greater understanding.

Furthermore, the idea that social justice activism is imposing boundaries and limitations on what people can do based on their race is a false dichotomy. Social justice activism is not about telling people what they can and cannot do, but rather about challenging the power structures that perpetuate inequality. It is about creating a society where everyone has an equal opportunity to participate and contribute, regardless of their background or identity. By promoting greater understanding and empathy, social justice activism can actually help to reduce racial divides and promote greater social cohesion.

In fact, social justice activism has led to numerous examples of increased representation and inclusion. For example, affirmative action policies have helped to increase diversity in education and employment, allowing individuals from underrepresented groups to access opportunities they may not have had otherwise. The representation of women and minorities in media and popular culture has increased significantly, providing more diverse role models and challenging stereotypes. These gains are not a result of social justice activism imposing restrictions, but rather of challenging societal norms and pushing for greater inclusivity.

The burden of proof lies with those who claim that social justice activism is making racial segregation worse. Instead of providing a single example of social justice activism leading to reduced segregation, one should look at the numerous examples of social justice activism achieving significant gains in promoting equality and challenging discriminatory norms.","The assertion that social justice activism is making racial segregation worse is a misinterpretation of the movement's goals and outcomes. In reality, social justice activism has led to a significant increase in representation and inclusion in the entertainment industry. Productions such as ""Crazy Rich Asians,"" ""Black Panther,"" and ""Roma"" have not only featured diverse casts and crews but have also achieved critical and commercial success. These films demonstrate that diverse storytelling can be both authentic and engaging, appealing to a broader audience and promoting creative freedom for actors and writers. By challenging the status quo and pushing for greater representation, social justice activism has created opportunities for underrepresented groups to break into the industry. Moreover, the emphasis on diversity and inclusion has led to a more nuanced understanding of the importance of cultural sensitivity and representation in storytelling. This, in turn, has resulted in more authentic and engaging portrayals of diverse characters, which can only serve to break down racial barriers and promote greater understanding. It is also worth noting that the notion that social justice activism imposes boundaries and limitations on what people can do based on their race is a gross exaggeration. In reality, the movement is focused on promoting equality and challenging systemic inequalities, not on restricting individual freedom. In fact, social justice activism has helped to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for people of all backgrounds to participate in the entertainment industry. By challenging discriminatory practices and promoting diversity, social justice activism has contributed to a more vibrant and inclusive cultural landscape. Rather than perpetuating segregation, social justice activism has helped to break down barriers and promote greater understanding and empathy.","The notion that social justice activism is exacerbating racial segregation rather than alleviating it is a mischaracterization of the movement's intentions and outcomes. While it is true that some social justice activists may employ divisive rhetoric, the overwhelming majority of activists aim to promote inclusivity and equality through challenging systemic barriers and biases. By focusing on the exceptions rather than the rule, critics of social justice often overlook the tangible progress made in various fields, such as education, employment, and criminal justice, where social justice activism has contributed to increased diversity and representation. For instance, the Black Lives Matter movement has led to significant reductions in police brutality against African Americans and a greater awareness of systemic racism within law enforcement.

Moreover, the examples provided by the critic  such as ""you can't disagree with people of color about racism because you're white""  represent a caricatured and inaccurate portrayal of social justice discourse. In reality, social justice activists are not advocating for a complete ban on differing opinions or perspectives, but rather for a more nuanced understanding of the historical and systemic contexts that shape experiences of racism and oppression. By engaging with diverse perspectives and challenging dominant narratives, social justice activism fosters a more inclusive and equitable environment where individuals feel comfortable sharing their experiences and advocating for change.

The request to provide a single example of social justice activism decreasing segregation is a straw man argument, as it implies that social justice activists have made no efforts to address segregation or promote equality. However, a plethora of examples exist, such as the increased participation of women and minorities in politics, the growing diversity in media representation, and the greater accessibility of education and employment opportunities for historically marginalized groups. Rather than relying on anecdotal evidence or cherry-picked examples, it is essential to consider the broader societal trends and data-driven research on the impact of social justice activism. By doing so, it becomes clear that social justice movements have been instrumental in driving progress towards a more inclusive and equitable society, one where individuals are not bound by the constraints of their perceived group identity but are free to express themselves and pursue their goals without facing undue barriers or restrictions."
t3_f7osv1,"Government positions should be unpaid I'm speaking from a US perspective, FYI. I think forcing government officials to rely on another source of income would be very beneficial. They wouldn't just be a congressperson or senator, they'd be that and and electrician, or that and a plumber, or hell that and a CEO I don't really care. Point is their income is elsewhere. 1. (least significant point) It would lower our taxes since the government doesn't have to pay their wages 
• It would force our lawmakers to work in the industries they affect. Wage laws would affect them too. Social programs, healthcare, etc, would all affect them just as much as they affect us. 3. Reelection no longer becomes a ""do whatever it takes or else you lose your job"" situation. You might lose your position of power sure but you won't lose your income. There's less backstabbing incentive. 4. It's no longer about money. People won't go into office for the paycheck. More people elected into office will truly care about their position and how they can help. Mind you this only applies to government officials (congress, senate, white house, etc), not people employed by the government (NASA employees, public school teachers, etc). There's where I stand, change my view. Where does my logic fall apart, am I missing anything?","The proposal to make government positions unpaid may seem appealing as a means to reduce the corrupting influence of money in politics, but it is unlikely to achieve its intended goal. By forcing government officials to rely on external income, they may actually become more beholden to their external employers or clients, rather than being accountable to the public. For instance, an unpaid congressman might still be influenced by their employer or industry, whether it be the electricians' union or the energy company they work for as a consultant. This could lead to a conflict of interest, where their external income and loyalty to their employer compromise their decisions as a public official. Moreover, the idea that making government officials financially independent would lead to more altruistic decision-making overlooks the fact that many individuals in positions of power are motivated by a desire to serve the public interest, rather than personal gain. This can be seen in the many public servants who have dedicated their lives to serving their communities without expectation of reward. Furthermore, the real issue lies not with the financial incentives, but rather the systemic issues that allow money to wield such influence in politics, such as the lack of campaign finance reform and the influence of special interest groups. A more effective solution would be to address these underlying issues, rather than attempting to circumvent them by making government officials' positions unpaid. Additionally, this proposal may not take into account the varying circumstances of individuals, such as those with family or medical responsibilities, who may rely on their government salary to support their loved ones. In conclusion, while the intention behind this proposal may be well-intentioned, it is a simplistic solution that fails to address the root causes of the problem and may even create new challenges and conflicts of interest.","While the idea of holding government officials to a higher standard by forcing them to rely on another source of income may seem appealing, it is fundamentally flawed. In medieval European settlements, skilled artisans often struggled to balance multiple roles, leading to a decline in the quality of their work and a rise in corruption. This is precisely the risk that making government officials hold multiple jobs poses. If a senator or congressman is also required to work as an electrician or plumber, their primary focus will inevitably be on their secondary profession, compromising their ability to effectively serve their constituents.

Moreover, the historian must consider the unique demands of governance, which require a deep understanding of complex policy, diplomacy, and strategic thinking. These skills are not easily complemented by another profession, and attempting to do so could lead to a dilution of the effectiveness of our government. Furthermore, relying on a second income source would create an uneven playing field, where officials from more affluent backgrounds would be better equipped to manage the demands of multiple jobs, while those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds would be at a disadvantage.

In addition, the historian must also consider the role of government officials in shaping the very policies that govern the industries they would be working in. If a senator is also working as an electrician, their votes on energy policy would be influenced by their personal financial interests, rather than the best interests of their constituents. This would create a clear conflict of interest, undermining the integrity of our democratic process. Rather than addressing the problems of corruption and special interests, the proposed system would only exacerbate them.

The historian must also consider the practical implications of this system, particularly in regards to the time commitment required to serve as a government official. If government officials are expected to hold multiple jobs, they would be forced to divide their time and attention between their various roles, making it impossible to effectively serve their constituents. This would lead to a decline in the quality of governance and a rise in bureaucratic inefficiency.

Ultimately, while the idea of holding government officials to a higher standard is a noble one, it is not achieved through forcing them to rely on another source of income. Rather, it is through robust campaign finance reform, stricter ethics laws, and a stronger emphasis on civic education that we can ensure our elected officials are truly accountable to the people they serve.","While the idea of unpaid government positions may seem appealing on the surface, it could ultimately lead to a homogenous group of candidates with the means to take on such a role without financial burden. In the entertainment industry, where casting directors like myself seek out talented individuals to bring unique perspectives and experiences to the screen, a similar pool of candidates with diverse backgrounds and professions is essential. Without a steady income, individuals from underrepresented communities, such as those from low-income households or with limited access to education, would be less likely to consider a career in public office. This could lead to a government that reflects the interests and values of the wealthy and privileged, rather than the diverse needs and concerns of the general population. Furthermore, unpaid positions would likely attract individuals who are already invested in the political process, such as activists or volunteers, rather than those who may be more neutral or objective. This could lead to a lack of fresh perspectives and ideas, ultimately hindering the ability of government to effectively address the complex issues facing the country. Additionally, the expectation that government officials would need to supplement their income outside of office could create a conflict of interest, where officials would be beholden to their external income sources rather than their constituents. For example, an official who is also a businessman or lawyer may be more likely to make decisions that benefit their business or industry rather than the public interest. This could lead to a government that is more focused on serving the interests of special groups rather than the broader public good. In the end, while the idea of unpaid government positions may seem idealistic, it could ultimately lead to a government that is less representative, less effective, and less accountable to the people it serves.","Implementing an unpaid government system ignores the vast differences in societal structures and economic realities across various nations. While some economies can afford to compensate their policymakers with private income streams, others may not be able to provide such luxuries. In many developing countries, officials are already expected to supplement their public salaries through side hustles or family businesses, which can lead to conflicts of interest and erode the notion of impartial governance. Moreover, the expectation that lawmakers will have an outside source of income assumes a level of economic security that is not universally attainable. For instance, individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds may be unable to balance multiple jobs or secure alternative sources of income, effectively excluding them from participating in politics altogether. The proposal also fails to account for the fact that policymakers often require specialized skills and training, which can only be developed through extensive education and experience  a luxury not all citizens can afford.","The idea that government officials should be unpaid overlooks the critical role these individuals play in maintaining national and global stability. Their expertise, experience, and networks are invaluable assets to their respective governments. Paying lawmakers is not a frivolous expense but rather an essential investment in ensuring effective governance. Without sufficient compensation, qualified candidates may be deterred from pursuing careers in public service, leading to a decline in the overall quality of representation. Furthermore, policymakers often face immense pressure and scrutiny, which can be both emotionally taxing and financially challenging. Unpaid government officials would likely struggle to cope with these demands, compromising their ability to perform duties effectively. Moreover, unpaid positions may attract individuals with ulterior motives or limited expertise, hindering the development of well-informed policies. In countries where politicians are unpaid, public service is often viewed as a secondary career path for those who have already accumulated wealth and privilege.","Unpaid government officials may unwittingly exacerbate existing issues of inequality and representation within their respective societies. Under this system, those who already hold power and wealth will continue to dominate public office, while marginalized groups with limited access to resources and opportunities will be disproportionately underrepresented in governance. By requiring policymakers to rely on external sources of income, the proposal inadvertently reinforces the notion that politics is a hobby for the affluent rather than a vital profession serving the general interest. Furthermore, unpaid positions may attract individuals who are motivated by personal gain or ideology, rather than a genuine commitment to public service and the well-being of their constituents. This could lead to policies that prioritize special interests over the needs of marginalized communities, ultimately undermining the very purpose of democratic representation."
t3_7oml7s,"People who allow their partner to abuse their children should themselves be charged with abuse, even if they don't ever directly nparticipate in the abuse If you let your kid play on the interstate regularly, for years on end, you'd absolutely be seen as negligent or at fault when the kid gets hurt. Maybe in those cases you hear about, where for example a man is sexually abusing a child over a long period, and the child comes to the mom for help and the mom denies it could possibly be happening, maybe knowing that the mom could get in trouble for sexual abuse of a child themselves might prompt her to do something instead of just deciding to be in denial. There are some cases, of course, where for example the wife herself is so terrorized, or is basically being held prisoner by the husband by whatever means, that it would be almost impossible for her to escape, but the courts could decide whether that was going on for each case. Of course I still think if the non-abusive caregiver has been clearly complacent and indifferent, they should be punished, but in those cases they probably usually are.  the CMV moderators.","The comparison between neglectful parenting and complicit caregiving in cases of child abuse is flawed. While allowing a child to play on an interstate highway may indeed be considered negligent, the consequences of such actions are generally limited to physical harm. In contrast, failing to prevent child abuse can lead to profound psychological trauma that lasts a lifetime. Moreover, the motivations behind neglectful parenting and complicit caregiving differ significantly. Neglectful parents often prioritize their own interests over those of their children, whereas individuals who fail to prevent abuse may be doing so out of desperation or fear. Rather than punishing these caregivers with charges of abuse, it would be more effective to provide them with support and resources to help them escape the abusive relationship.","The notion that those who fail to prevent child abuse should be charged with abuse themselves overlooks the complexities of domestic violence and coercion. In situations where abusers exert total control over their victims, escape is virtually impossible without external intervention. Blaming the non-abusive caregiver for not intervening may inadvertently penalize individuals who are themselves trapped in a cycle of abuse. Furthermore, this approach ignores the fact that some caregivers may be unaware of the abuse or may have been misled by their partner. For instance, children often hide evidence of abuse from their caregivers due to fear or shame. Charging these individuals with abuse would not only be unfair but also counterproductive, as it could exacerbate the situation and discourage victims from seeking help.","The suggestion that charging non-abusive caregivers with abuse could prompt them to take action against their partner oversimplifies the dynamics at play in situations of domestic violence. Research has shown that individuals who are being abused often feel trapped, isolated, and powerless, making it difficult for them to seek help or leave their abuser. Charging them with abuse would only add to their sense of guilt and shame, potentially silencing them further. Furthermore, this approach relies on the assumption that caregivers have the necessary resources and support to intervene effectively. In reality, many individuals may not have access to counseling services, safe housing, or financial stability, making it even more challenging for them to escape an abusive relationship. A more effective strategy would be to provide caregivers with comprehensive support systems and hold abusers accountable through specific charges related to their actions.","While it's true that the absence of intervention can perpetuate abuse, it's essential to consider the multifaceted nature of these situations. Charging a non-abusive caregiver with abuse may inadvertently create a culture of fear, where those who are aware of abuse but fail to act feel compelled to maintain silence to avoid prosecution. This could lead to a chilling effect, where potential whistleblowers are deterred from coming forward, allowing abuse to continue unchecked. The courts and social services already have mechanisms in place to investigate and address situations where caregivers have been complicit or actively involved in abuse, and it's crucial to rely on these established systems rather than creating a new, potentially counterproductive framework.

Moreover, the complexities of human behavior and the dynamics of abuse often defy simplistic categorizations. A caregiver may be aware of abuse, but feel powerless to stop it due to fear, coercion, or manipulation. Charging them with abuse would only exacerbate their situation, making it even more difficult for them to escape or seek help. In some cases, the non-abusive caregiver may be the only available support system for the victim, and prosecuting them could further isolate the child. It's crucial to prioritize the well-being and safety of the child while also considering the potential consequences of our actions on the caregiver.

A more effective approach might involve providing resources and support to caregivers who are struggling to intervene or seeking help for themselves or their loved ones. By doing so, we can empower them to take action without fear of retribution, thereby creating a safer environment for the child and holding the actual perpetrators accountable. This nuanced approach acknowledges the complexities of abuse and its effects on all parties involved, rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all solution that may inadvertently harm more than it helps.","While the intention behind holding caregivers accountable for their complicity in child abuse is well-intentioned, the proposed solution may inadvertently create a culture of fear and retribution rather than facilitating effective prevention and rehabilitation. The distinction between direct perpetrators and those who enable or fail to prevent abuse is crucial in transitional justice contexts, where the focus is on restoring justice, truth, and accountability. In cases where caregivers are complicit but not directly responsible, punishment may not serve as an effective deterrent or promote healing for the victims. In fact, it could lead to further marginalization and stigmatization of already vulnerable individuals who may be struggling with their own experiences of trauma or coercion.

Moreover, a more nuanced approach would prioritize education, support, and rehabilitation for caregivers who are complicit in abuse, rather than solely focusing on punishment. This could involve providing access to counseling, training, and resources to help them recognize and prevent abuse, as well as facilitating their cooperation with investigations and the implementation of measures to protect the child. By doing so, we can create a more constructive and restorative justice process that prioritizes the well-being and safety of the child, while also addressing the complex power dynamics and vulnerabilities that often contribute to abuse.

Furthermore, the proposed solution may not adequately account for the ways in which systemic and structural factors contribute to child abuse, such as poverty, lack of access to resources, and societal attitudes that perpetuate violence against children. By conflating complicity and direct perpetration, we risk overlooking the systemic issues that need to be addressed in order to prevent future abuses. A more effective approach would prioritize addressing these underlying factors, rather than solely targeting individual caregivers. This would require a multifaceted strategy that involves policymakers, social services, and community leaders working together to create a safer and more supportive environment for children. Ultimately, a nuanced and context-dependent approach to addressing child abuse is essential for promoting justice, accountability, and healing for all parties involved.","While the intention behind holding non-abusive caregivers accountable for abuse cases may be to prompt action and protect children, criminalizing them could have unintended consequences that ultimately harm the very people it aims to help. In many cases, the non-abusive caregiver may be a crucial link between the abused child and the outside world, providing emotional support and resources that are essential for the child's well-being. By charging them with abuse, the state may inadvertently sever this lifeline, leaving the child without a support system and potentially exacerbating the abuse. Furthermore, the added stress and anxiety of facing potential prosecution may cause non-abusive caregivers to become even more entrenched in the situation, making it more difficult for the child to escape.

Moreover, the lack of clear guidelines for determining complicity in abuse cases raises significant concerns about fairness and due process. Without a clear definition of ""complacency"" and ""indifference,"" caregivers may be unfairly targeted and prosecuted based on subjective interpretations of their actions. This could lead to a chilling effect, where caregivers become reluctant to report suspected abuse for fear of being accused themselves, thereby hindering the reporting of actual abuse cases. Additionally, the already overburdened court system may be overwhelmed by the added caseload of non-abusive caregivers, diverting resources away from the most critical cases and slowing down the process of bringing perpetrators to justice.

In some instances, non-abusive caregivers may be more effective in facilitating the reporting of abuse and providing support to the child if they are not burdened with the added weight of prosecution. For instance, in cases where the abuser is a family member or close relative, the non-abusive caregiver may be the only one aware of the abuse, and their role in providing emotional support and resources may be essential in helping the child come forward. By focusing on education, support, and resources for non-abusive caregivers, rather than punishment, policymakers can create a more effective and supportive system for addressing abuse cases. Ultimately, a more nuanced approach that balances the need for accountability with the need for compassion and support is necessary to ensure that both the child and the non-abusive caregiver receive the help they need."
t3_e4ih37,"Bank safety for personal checking accounts is excessive in Europe Because of work, I have lived in a number of European countries where I opened bank accounts for salary deposits, personal expenses, bank transfers, etc. In addition, I have always had one or more bank accounts in Canada where I have my permanent residence. My biggest shock with European banks is how complicated it can be to open a bank account and the number of safety features the banks impose on account holders. In Canada, you can open a bank account online without requiring any human assistance. You only require a social security number and must declare that you live in Canada. The bank card is received by mail and the PIN is chosen by the account holder over the phone. In the UK, you must come in person to the branch and there, present an ID and a proof of address. You later receive the bank card and PIN by mail. In Switzerland, same as the UK, but you must use a home card reader to access online banking services using your PIN to unlock your account. In France, same as UK, but you must pick-up the card in person at the bank. A verification by SMS is required for online transactions and bank transfers.  In Czech Republic, same as France, but the PIN is sent by SMS and is encoded. You must decode the PIN number yourself using a key provided by the bank (which, of course, you must pick-up in person). To access online banking, the bank will install on your computer a digital certificate. I don't understand why all these features (proof of address, SMS validation, bank card pick-up, digital certificate) are necessary when other countries like Canada don't use them. I must also point out that the Canadian banking system is being one of the safest in the world and that frauds are not common to my knowledge. I can only conclude the safety European banks is overkill which makes the banks themselves rather inefficient and bureaucratic.","While it is true that the Canadian banking system is renowned for its simplicity and efficiency, a closer examination of the European banking landscape reveals a more nuanced picture. European banks, unlike their Canadian counterparts, operate in a more complex regulatory environment, with stricter data protection and anti-money laundering laws. These stringent regulations necessitate the implementation of robust security measures, such as proof of address, SMS validation, and digital certificates, to ensure the integrity of the financial system and protect sensitive customer information. Rather than viewing these measures as excessive, they can be seen as a testament to European banks' commitment to customer security and data protection.

Moreover, the seemingly restrictive security protocols in Europe may be a trade-off for the benefits of a highly developed digital banking ecosystem. European banks have invested heavily in online banking services, mobile apps, and contactless payments, providing customers with unparalleled convenience and accessibility. In contrast, Canada's banking system, while efficient, may be less advanced in terms of digital banking capabilities. A closer look at the European banking landscape reveals that customers are willing to trade off convenience for the added security and peace of mind that comes with robust security measures.

Additionally, the notion that European banks are inefficient and bureaucratic is a misconception. In reality, many European banks have implemented innovative solutions to streamline their services, such as online account opening, mobile banking apps, and automated customer support. These advancements have reduced wait times, increased customer satisfaction, and enhanced the overall banking experience. While the security measures may seem cumbersome, they are a crucial component of a larger strategy to provide a secure and trustworthy banking experience.

In conclusion, European banking systems are not inherently more restrictive or bureaucratic than Canadian banks. Rather, they operate in a more complex regulatory environment, which necessitates robust security measures to protect customers and the financial system. By adopting a more nuanced perspective, it becomes clear that the added security measures are a vital aspect of European banking, providing customers with peace of mind and trust in the banking system.","While it's true that the process of opening a bank account can be more complicated in Europe compared to Canada, it's essential to recognize that this complexity is not necessarily a hindrance, but rather a reflection of the diverse needs and priorities of European societies. The unique cultural, economic, and regulatory environments in each country necessitate tailored banking systems that address specific security concerns. For instance, the French requirement for in-person pick-up of bank cards and SMS verification for online transactions may be a response to the high incidence of identity theft and online fraud in France. Similarly, the digital certificate installed by Czech banks for online banking may be a measure to protect against cyber threats, given the country's history of cyber attacks.

Furthermore, the Canadian banking system, often cited as a model for efficiency, has its own set of challenges and vulnerabilities. The fact that Canadians can open bank accounts online without requiring human assistance may leave them more susceptible to identity theft and online scams, particularly among the elderly and those with limited technical expertise. In contrast, the layered security measures in European banks, such as proof of address and PIN verification, may be more effective in preventing such crimes. Additionally, European banks' emphasis on physical verification and human interaction can foster stronger relationships between banks and customers, potentially leading to improved customer service and loyalty.

Moreover, the notion that European banks are ""inefficient and bureaucratic"" overlooks the fact that these institutions are responding to the specific needs and expectations of their customers. In countries like the UK and Switzerland, where personal financial security is a top priority, banks are more likely to implement robust safety measures to alleviate concerns. Rather than viewing these measures as excessive, it's essential to recognize that they are a reflection of the banks' commitment to protecting their customers and upholding the highest standards of security.

Ultimately, the adaptability and diversity of European banking systems are strengths, not weaknesses. By acknowledging and embracing these differences, we can learn from the various approaches to banking and security, and develop more effective and responsive financial systems that cater to the unique needs of diverse populations.","While the comparison between European and Canadian banking systems may initially seem striking, it is essential to consider the diverse contexts in which these systems operate. Europe's banking landscape is shaped by its history, geography, and the presence of systemic risks such as terrorism, cybercrime, and corruption. The European Union's experience with these threats has led to a heightened awareness of the importance of robust security measures, including proof of address, SMS validation, and digital certificates. These measures are not merely bureaucratic obstacles, but rather a response to the real and persistent risks faced by European banks and their customers.

Moreover, the data on financial crimes in Europe suggests that the region has been a hub for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities. The European banking system's emphasis on security measures can be seen as a proactive approach to preventing these types of crimes, rather than simply reacting to individual instances of fraud. The relatively low incidence of fraud in Canadian banking, as cited by the original author, may be a result of Canada's smaller and more homogeneous population, as well as its geographical isolation. However, this does not necessarily mean that European banks are overkill, but rather that they are adapting to the unique demands of their environment.

In addition, the European banking system's emphasis on digital certificates and home card readers may seem cumbersome to the casual user, but it provides an added layer of security for online transactions and bank transfers. This is particularly important in a region with a high prevalence of cybercrime. The digital certificate, for example, ensures that only the account holder can access their online banking services, reducing the risk of unauthorized transactions. The use of home card readers adds an extra layer of security for high-risk transactions, such as international money transfers.

Furthermore, the requirement for in-person identification and address verification may seem overly burdensome, but it serves as a critical check against identity theft and account takeover. This is especially important in a region where identity documents and identification systems are not always as robust as in North America. By considering the broader context of European banking, it becomes clear that the complexity and security measures are not a result of inefficiency, but rather a deliberate response to the unique challenges faced by European banks and their customers.","The argument that bank safety features in Europe are excessive may overlook the unique cultural and historical contexts that have shaped banking practices on the continent. In many European countries, a strong emphasis is placed on trust and risk aversion, particularly when it comes to financial institutions. This is reflected in the implementation of rigorous identity verification processes and robust security measures to protect against fraud and cyber threats. For instance, the UK's Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations are designed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing by ensuring that banks thoroughly vet their customers. These stringent requirements may appear cumbersome compared to Canada's more streamlined process, but they are a deliberate response to the region's complex financial landscape. Moreover, European banks have a significant track record of effectively managing risk and maintaining high levels of customer trust, despite the seeming inefficiencies in their processes.","The assumption that European bank safety features are ""overkill"" and a reflection of inefficiency ignores the fact that many countries on the continent have faced significant financial crises in recent decades. The aftermath of the global financial crisis, for instance, highlighted the need for banks to prioritize risk management and regulatory compliance. In response, European policymakers have taken steps to strengthen banking regulations, including the implementation of capital requirements and stress-testing exercises. These measures are designed to promote a culture of prudent risk-taking among financial institutions and to maintain confidence in the banking system. While this may lead to what appears to be excessive safety features from an outsider's perspective, they are actually a deliberate response to the specific challenges faced by European banks in recent years.","The comparison between European bank safety measures and those in Canada may be unfair, as it glosses over the different regulatory environments that govern banking practices in each region. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for example, places a high premium on protecting sensitive customer data, which necessitates more stringent security protocols. Similarly, EU member states are subject to stricter anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulations, which require banks to implement enhanced due diligence processes. These regulatory frameworks have contributed to the development of robust safety features in European banking systems, even if they may seem overly complex or bureaucratic by Canadian standards. Furthermore, these measures are designed to protect not only individual customers but also the broader financial system from potential threats."
t3_pcawwd,"social media are ruining my generation I'm a 20 years old male and I think social media are more bad than good for my generation, hear me out. They don't teach inclusivity cause several races are left out from the equation and also thinnernormal body types. They help glorify sex work in an ill way and encourage it, which is degrading and has several mental effect on women and men of all ages. They push women to be slutty to feel empowered confusing the two concepts and push men to be too masculine and to view women as objects and to not respect them. Also don't get me started on the body dysmorphia. Also reaserch show that seeing your friends always posting their best self on social media and comparing yourself to them makes u depressed and unsatisfied with your life, and no, the ""remember social media is fake"" trend is like pissing into a fire trying to estinguish it, it does t solve the problem. the only thing they're good is to keep in touch with poeple but the posting part is totally useless and it's just a way to get validation for a generation that is willing to do the dumbest shit to get it. Also tik tok should be canceled. It is basically a pdohorny guyscreeps dream come true where they can see underage girls dressing and acting in revealing ""clothes "" desperate for likes but they don't know where they come from. Also it is a Chinese company that doesn't give a shut about your privacy just saying... They are also the worst source to get information from cause 90 percent of the time reaserch and statistics is manipulated or not cited(like this post lol) and fake news are spread like crazy 
Hope someone will change my point of view since I have the sin to still using them daily and I need to feel good about myself even tho we all know these things.","Social media platforms are indeed complex and multifaceted, and their impact on individuals and society is far more nuanced than a blanket statement of being ""ruining"" an entire generation. Rather than dismissing social media entirely, it is essential to acknowledge its potential to democratize access to information, amplify marginalized voices, and provide a space for self-expression and connection. Consider the countless young people who have used social media to mobilize around social justice causes, raise awareness about important issues, and build communities around shared interests. For example, the MeToo movement, which began as a social media campaign, has sparked a global conversation about consent, power dynamics, and accountability.

Moreover, social media can be a powerful tool for representation and inclusivity, allowing underrepresented groups to showcase their talents, experiences, and perspectives. Many social media platforms have made a concerted effort to improve their accessibility features, allowing users with disabilities to engage more easily with online content. Additionally, platforms like TikTok have provided a space for young people to express themselves creatively, showcasing their talents and skills in a way that might not have been possible through traditional media.

It is also worth noting that the issues you mention, such as body dysmorphia, mental health, and the objectification of women, are not exclusive to social media. These issues have been present in society for centuries, and social media is simply a reflection of broader cultural problems. Rather than blaming social media for these issues, it is more productive to address the root causes and work towards creating a more inclusive and empathetic society.

Furthermore, research has shown that social media can also have positive effects on mental health, such as providing a sense of community and connection for individuals who may be isolated or marginalized. For example, online support groups and forums have been instrumental in helping people cope with mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression.

Rather than advocating for the cancellation of social media platforms like TikTok, it would be more productive to work with the companies to address concerns around safety and content moderation. This could involve implementing more robust reporting mechanisms, increasing transparency around data collection and usage, and promoting digital literacy and online safety education. By engaging with social media in a thoughtful and intentional way, young people can harness its potential to create positive change and build a more inclusive and empathetic society.","While it is true that social media platforms can perpetuate unrealistic beauty standards, promote objectification, and contribute to mental health concerns, it is essential to consider the ways in which social media is also a tool for promoting inclusivity, diversity, and positive body image. Many social media platforms have made significant efforts to increase representation of diverse body types, ages, and abilities, and to promote body positivity and self-acceptance. For example, the hashtag BodyPositivity on Instagram has become a platform for individuals to share their stories and promote self-acceptance, while the hashtag InclusiveFashion has encouraged brands to showcase a more diverse range of models and sizes. Furthermore, social media can provide a space for marginalized communities to connect, organize, and amplify their voices, which can be particularly important for those who may feel excluded or silenced in traditional media.

It is also worth noting that the negative effects of social media are not inherent to the platforms themselves, but rather a result of how they are used and the cultural context in which they operate. For instance, the pressure to present a perfect online image can be exacerbated by societal beauty standards and the desire for validation, rather than the platforms themselves. Moreover, social media can also be a tool for promoting critical thinking and media literacy, by encouraging users to critically evaluate the information they consume and to question the representations presented to them. In this sense, social media can be seen as a space for education and empowerment, rather than simply a tool for promoting unhealthy behaviors.

Regarding the issue of sex work and objectification, it is essential to consider the complexities of online discourse and the ways in which sex work is represented and regulated. While it is true that some social media platforms have been criticized for allowing explicit content, it is also the case that these platforms have implemented measures to protect users and to promote safe and respectful interactions. Furthermore, sex work is a legitimate profession that deserves to be recognized and respected, and social media can provide a platform for sex workers to connect with clients, share their experiences, and advocate for their rights.

In terms of the Chinese ownership of TikTok, it is true that the platform's data policies have raised concerns about user privacy. However, it is also worth noting that many social media platforms, including those owned by Western companies, have also faced criticism for their data handling practices. Moreover, TikTok has taken steps to address these concerns, such as introducing more transparent data policies and partnering with independent auditors to ensure compliance with data regulations.

Ultimately, the issue of social media's impact on young people's lives is complex and multifaceted, and it cannot be reduced to a simple critique of the platforms themselves. Rather, it is essential to consider the ways in which social media operates within the broader social and cultural context, and to recognize both the potential benefits and drawbacks of these platforms. By taking a nuanced and balanced view, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and positive online environment that promotes healthy behaviors, promotes diversity and representation, and respects the complexities of human experience.","While it is understandable that social media can perpetuate negative influences and unrealistic expectations, such as unattainable beauty standards and the commercialization of sex work, these issues are not inherent to the platforms themselves, but rather a result of human behavior and societal pressures. In fact, social media can be a powerful tool for promoting inclusivity, diversity, and body positivity. Many social media platforms have implemented features and initiatives aimed at reducing cyberbullying, promoting digital literacy, and providing resources for mental health and well-being. Furthermore, social media has facilitated the rise of online communities and support networks for individuals with marginalized identities, providing a sense of belonging and connection for those who may feel isolated or excluded in their offline lives.

Moreover, research suggests that social media can have a positive impact on mental health when used in moderation and as part of a balanced online and offline life. For example, social media can provide a platform for individuals to express themselves, share their experiences, and connect with others who share similar interests and identities. This can lead to increased feelings of self-esteem, social support, and a sense of belonging, which are critical for maintaining good mental health. Additionally, social media can be a valuable tool for education and information-sharing, providing access to a vast array of perspectives, resources, and knowledge that can help individuals develop a more nuanced understanding of the world and its complexities.

In terms of online safety, social media companies are taking steps to address concerns about child safety, moderation, and data protection. While there is still much work to be done, it is not accurate to say that social media companies are ""Chinese companies that don't give a shut about your privacy."" Many social media platforms have implemented robust data protection policies, invested in AI-powered moderation tools, and collaborated with experts and organizations to develop best practices for online safety and well-being.

Ultimately, the key to mitigating the negative effects of social media is not to abandon these platforms altogether, but to use them in a responsible and informed way. This means being aware of the potential pitfalls, setting boundaries, and engaging in offline activities and connections that promote well-being and a sense of purpose. By approaching social media with a critical and nuanced understanding of its potential benefits and drawbacks, individuals can harness its power to enhance their lives and relationships, rather than letting it control or define them.","The argument that social media are a primary cause of depression, anxiety, and dissatisfaction with life overlooks the complex interplay between individual experiences, socioeconomic factors, and online behavior. Research has shown that people who use social media excessively or experience cyberbullying are at higher risk for mental health concerns. However, this doesn't mean that social media themselves are the root cause.

Instead of blaming social media, we should focus on promoting healthy online habits and providing support services for individuals struggling with mental health issues. This can include education programs about digital literacy, online safety, and responsible social media use. Additionally, platforms like Instagram and TikTok have implemented features to promote well-being, such as ""Take a Break"" and ""Mental Health Resources.""

Moreover, social media can also provide opportunities for people to connect with others who share similar experiences or struggles. Online communities focused on mental health support, self-care, and emotional well-being can offer valuable resources and connections.

Rather than canceling platforms like TikTok, we should work towards creating a more inclusive, compassionate, and responsible online environment that promotes positive relationships, creativity, and personal growth. This requires ongoing efforts from individuals, organizations, and policymakers to address the complex issues surrounding social media use and its impact on mental health.","The argument that social media are ruining a generation overlooks the numerous benefits these platforms provide. Firstly, social media have democratized access to information and enable people from all walks of life to share their experiences and perspectives. This has led to increased awareness about various social issues, including inclusivity, body image, and mental health. For instance, social media campaigns such as MeToo and BodyPositivity have helped create a more inclusive online environment where individuals can express themselves freely without fear of judgment. Furthermore, platforms like Instagram and TikTok provide opportunities for marginalized communities to showcase their creativity and talent, promoting diversity and representation.

Moreover, social media have also enabled people to connect with others across geographical boundaries, creating a sense of community and belonging. This is particularly crucial for young people who may face isolation or exclusion due to various factors such as rural living or mental health conditions. Research has shown that online social connections can positively impact mental health outcomes, particularly among individuals with anxiety and depression.

It's also worth noting that social media platforms have implemented numerous measures to address issues like body dysmorphia, cyberbullying, and misinformation. For example, Instagram has introduced features such as ""Take a Break"" and ""Mental Health Resources,"" which aim to promote healthy online habits and provide support for users struggling with mental health concerns.

While it's true that social media can have negative effects if used excessively or inappropriately, this doesn't necessarily mean they're inherently bad. By acknowledging both the benefits and drawbacks of social media, we can work towards creating a more balanced and inclusive online environment that promotes positive relationships, creativity, and personal growth.","The notion that social media are primarily responsible for promoting sex work, objectification, and body dysmorphia oversimplifies the complex issues at play. Sex work, in particular, is often linked to poverty, lack of education, and economic inequality. Rather than blaming social media, it's essential to address these underlying structural problems.

Moreover, platforms like Instagram and TikTok are not solely responsible for promoting a narrow beauty standard or objectification. Social media reflect societal norms and expectations, and by highlighting the diversity of human experiences, they can also challenge these norms. For instance, influencers and content creators are using social media to promote body positivity, self-acceptance, and inclusivity.

It's also worth noting that sex work is not exclusively promoted on social media; it's a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. Research has shown that many individuals involved in sex work do so as a means of survival or to express their agency and autonomy. Rather than stigmatizing or policing sex workers, we should focus on providing support services and addressing the systemic inequalities that drive this industry.

Regarding body dysmorphia, social media can serve as both a reflection and a driver of societal beauty standards. However, by promoting diversity, inclusivity, and positive representations of body types, we can work towards creating a more compassionate online environment."
t3_9rzmej,"It's impractical to use ""Innocent until proven Guilty"" approach to non-legal, everyday settings. I have been inspired by people saying that we should be using the ""Innocent until proven Guilty"", not only in a strictly legal settings, but as a way of life. While this is definitely the most fair, I fail to see how practical it is. Starting off, nearly 100 of our interpersonal decisions are made from links of trust, not proof. If two different people tell me a different story, and one of the two people were someone I knew, I would trust my friend over the stranger. When there is no proof, and the only things left are two personal accounts, I would trust my friend who I would know of their character. Now, I am not saying that my friend is always right, or that it is rational to only trust someone who you personally know. I am saying it is impractical to NOT believe your friend on the account that there is no evidence. Let's pretend that I was a boss. Two people are held for an interview. One person is rumored to have a terrible personality. The other person isn't talked about. Given similar specs, I would hire the person without those rumors. Is it possible that they were false rumors? Of course. But I don't care about justice. It is more convenient for me to just choose someone without those circumstances regardless of the truth. There is no point in me sorting through their drama when there is a much easier alternative. To me, most people live their lives under the assumptions that our acquaintances would not lie to us. And that makes sense. If you think otherwise, please CMV
• the CMV moderators.","The argument that it's impractical to follow the ""Innocent until proven Guilty"" principle in everyday settings ignores the subtle yet significant impact of social norms and cultural expectations. In many communities, individuals are expected to behave with integrity and honesty, and those who fail to meet these standards can face reputational consequences. By not considering alternative explanations or possibilities for questionable behavior, one may inadvertently perpetuate a culture that values conformity over critical thinking. The example of trusting a friend's account over a stranger's story overlooks the potential biases that can influence such decisions. Friendships are built on shared experiences and mutual understanding, but these factors do not necessarily guarantee objectivity.","The assumption that ""Innocent until proven Guilty"" is impractical in everyday life neglects the value of trust and relationships. While it may be true that nearly all interpersonal decisions are based on degrees of trust, this does not mean that such trust should be undermined by a strict adherence to evidentiary standards. In fact, trusting others can foster deeper connections and more harmonious social interactions. Furthermore, the example of hiring an interviewee without considering rumors about their personality illustrates a missed opportunity for growth and learning through difficult conversations. Employers who prioritize convenience over due diligence may miss out on valuable insights that could inform better decision-making.","The notion that it's impractical to use the ""Innocent until proven Guilty"" approach in everyday life dismisses the value of nuance and context in human interactions. While it may be true that most people rely on trust rather than proof when making decisions, this does not mean that such trust should be unconditional or unwavering. In fact, the opposite is often the case: trusting others requires a willingness to engage with complexities and uncertainties, rather than simply assuming the best. By not considering multiple perspectives or engaging in open-ended conversations, individuals may miss out on opportunities for growth, learning, and deeper understanding of one another. The convenience of avoiding difficult conversations can ultimately lead to shallow relationships and impoverished social connections.","The assumption that people generally act with integrity and honesty is a cornerstone of a well-functioning society. When we assume that acquaintances would not lie to us, we create an environment where trust is fostered and relationships are built on a foundation of mutual respect. This is not to say that we should ignore evidence or neglect critical thinking, but rather that we should not dismiss the value of trust in our decision-making processes. In the context of hiring a new employee, for instance, relying on rumors and personal biases may lead to missed opportunities and poor hiring decisions. By prioritizing fairness and considering multiple perspectives, employers can tap into a broader pool of candidates and create a more inclusive work environment. Furthermore, adopting an ""innocent until proven guilty"" approach in everyday interactions can help to mitigate the potential for groupthink and polarization, which are detrimental to effective decision-making and social cohesion. In addition, a society that values fairness and trust is more likely to foster a culture of accountability, where individuals are held responsible for their actions and mistakes are acknowledged and learned from. While it may be true that assuming innocence can lead to some inconvenience in the short term, the long-term benefits of a fair and trusting society far outweigh the costs. In fact, studies have shown that societies with strong social cohesion and trust exhibit higher levels of economic growth, better health outcomes, and increased civic engagement. By prioritizing fairness and trust, we can create a more resilient and sustainable social structure that benefits individuals and communities alike. Ultimately, the ""innocent until proven guilty"" approach is not just a philosophical ideal, but a practical strategy for building stronger, more effective relationships and communities.","The notion that it is impractical to adopt the ""Innocent until proven Guilty"" approach in everyday settings, particularly in professional environments, fails to account for the inherent complexities of human relationships and the importance of empathy in decision-making. The idea that convenience and existing relationships should take precedence over fairness and due process oversimplifies the dynamics of trust and collaboration. In the field of casting for TV and film productions, for instance, building trust with actors, directors, and crew members is crucial for successful project execution. It is not solely about making decisions based on incomplete information or unverified accounts, but about understanding the nuances of human behavior and character.

When considering hiring actors for a project, it is not just about weighing the pros and cons of hiring someone with a potentially negative reputation versus an unknown quantity. It's about understanding that people are not always defined by their past mistakes or negative rumors, and that second chances and growth are essential for personal and professional development. Moreover, relying solely on speculation and hearsay can lead to overlooking talented individuals who have the potential to excel in a role, ultimately hindering the creative process. In reality, most people do not live in a world where every interaction is transactional and based on strict evidence, but rather where relationships are built on trust, empathy, and understanding.

The ""Innocent until proven Guilty"" approach may seem impractical in the short term, but it fosters a more inclusive and growth-oriented environment, where people are given the opportunity to redeem themselves and prove their capabilities. By adopting this approach, individuals and organizations can tap into a wider pool of talented and dedicated professionals who may have been unfairly maligned or overlooked due to incomplete information. This, in turn, can lead to more diverse and innovative projects, as well as a more positive and supportive work environment. Ultimately, the benefits of adopting the ""Innocent until proven Guilty"" approach far outweigh the perceived drawbacks, and it is a crucial step towards creating a more just and equitable society.","While the suggestion of applying the ""Innocent until proven Guilty"" principle in everyday settings may seem idealistic, it is crucial to recognize that this principle is not merely a moral or philosophical concept, but a fundamental right enshrined in international law. Upholding this principle is essential in promoting a culture of accountability, where individuals are not judged based on assumptions or rumors, but on verifiable facts and evidence. By adopting a more stringent approach to decision-making, we can foster a society where individuals are treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their social status, background, or perceived character. This, in turn, can lead to a more just and equitable society, where the rights of the marginalized and vulnerable are protected.

In the example provided, the boss's decision to hire the individual without the rumors may seem like a convenient solution, but it ignores the potential consequences of such an approach. By ignoring the rumors, the boss may inadvertently perpetuate a culture of silence and impunity, where individuals who have committed wrongdoings feel emboldened to continue their behavior, knowing that their actions will not be held to account. Moreover, such an approach can also lead to a lack of trust and credibility within the workplace, as colleagues may question the boss's integrity and the fairness of the hiring process. In contrast, by prioritizing the principle of ""Innocent until proven Guilty,"" the boss would be sending a strong message that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect, and that their rights will be protected, regardless of their perceived character or social status.

Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that the ""Innocent until proven Guilty"" principle is not a zero-sum game, where individuals are either innocent or guilty. Rather, it acknowledges that individuals can make mistakes, but also recognizes that they have the right to a fair and impartial process to clear their name and rebuild their reputation. By upholding this principle, we can create a society where individuals are encouraged to take risks, make mistakes, and learn from them, without fear of retribution or persecution. In the long run, this can lead to a more resilient and adaptive society, where individuals are empowered to grow and thrive.

Ultimately, while convenience and efficiency may seem like attractive alternatives to the ""Innocent until proven Guilty"" principle, they are not substitutes for justice and fairness. By prioritizing these values, we can create a society that is more just, equitable, and respectful of human rights, where the rights of all individuals are protected, and where trust and dignity are the foundation of our relationships."
t3_p7wyfb,"Exams should be open booknotes. As an engineering student I find this to be very crucial in learning. Memorizing the material for an exam is not a good way in learning the material whereas having an open book exam makes learning the materials much easier. All exams should be open resources. It increases note taking skills that are actually used in life and the work field and decrease exam stress. It's not fair to automatically assume that all students can retain a mass amount of information. Exams should be applicable based and not a memory test. You retain more information by actually doing research and learning the materials than cramping X amount of information then pouring it out onto a test and forget what you learned as soon as you turn it in. The whole point is to learn the materials, not just memorize information that you will forget. Not everyone can retain information well so by using resources given to youusing outside resources you gain a better understandingdifferent view of the material which will help you solve a problem that you don't know the answer to. Edit: for anyone wondering, I am studying electrical engineering in robotics and mechatronics.","Implementing open booknotes policies across all exams may overlook the diversity of learning styles and needs among students. Some individuals, regardless of the availability of resources, struggle with retaining information due to cognitive or learning disabilities. By providing access to external materials during exams, educators may inadvertently create a disadvantage for these students. Moreover, open book exams can lead to a lack of authenticity in assessments, as students are no longer being evaluated on their understanding of the material but rather on their ability to find answers quickly. In certain fields like science or engineering, professionals often rely on standardized protocols and reference materials that provide a common foundation for understanding complex concepts. By using open book exams, educators may inadvertently create a culture where students prioritize finding shortcuts over truly mastering these fundamental principles. A more inclusive approach would be to offer accommodations and support services for students with learning needs while maintaining rigorous assessments that reward critical thinking and problem-solving skills.","The assumption that open book exams are inherently more conducive to learning is not supported by evidence. In many fields, students who perform well on closed-book exams tend to excel in their careers as well. This is because such assessments require a deeper understanding of the material and the ability to apply it in new contexts. Moreover, relying too heavily on outside resources during exams can make students less effective problem solvers. When faced with real-world challenges, professionals often have limited access to information and must rely on their critical thinking skills and experience to find solutions. By preparing students for such scenarios through closed-book exams, educators can better equip them for success in the workforce. It is also worth noting that open book exams may not be as effective in developing note-taking skills as proponents claim. Effective note-taking requires more than simply having access to external resources; it demands an ability to organize and synthesize information, which can only be developed through consistent practice. In contrast, closed-book exams require students to carefully review their notes and apply them in new contexts.","The proposal to make all exams open booknotes may seem appealing, but it raises important questions about the nature of learning and assessment. While it is true that retaining information for a test can be stressful, it also serves as an essential check on students' understanding of the material. By relying on outside resources during exams, students may not develop the critical thinking skills necessary to evaluate complex information. Moreover, open book exams can create a culture where students prioritize finding answers over truly learning the subject matter. For instance, in certain fields like law or medicine, professionals are often required to recall and apply vast amounts of information under time pressure. In such cases, memorization is not merely a means to an end but rather a crucial skill itself. Furthermore, open book exams can also create opportunities for cheating and academic dishonesty. A more nuanced approach might be to allow students access to resources during some portions of the exam while requiring others to be completed without external help. This would encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills while still acknowledging that retaining information is an important aspect of learning.","The argument that exams should be open booknotes may be well-intentioned, but it overlooks the fundamental purpose of education: to evaluate a student's understanding of the material, not just their ability to access it. In the field of natural language processing, for instance, accuracy and precision are paramount when working with large datasets and complex algorithms. A student's ability to recall and apply fundamental concepts without the aid of external resources is crucial in this context. Moreover, open book exams may inadvertently create a culture of dependency on resources, rather than encouraging students to truly internalize the material. 

In many real-world scenarios, professionals are not given access to resources and must rely on their own knowledge and problem-solving skills to overcome challenges. For example, a data scientist working on a project may not have access to a vast library of resources; they must rely on their understanding of the underlying concepts and algorithms to make informed decisions. Exams that are based on memorization rather than understanding may not adequately prepare students for such situations. Furthermore, the ability to recall information from memory can be an asset in its own right, as it allows for faster decision-making and problem-solving in high-pressure situations. 

The author's argument that students should be allowed to use resources during exams because they will need to do so in their future careers overlooks the fact that the ability to learn and adapt quickly is a valuable skill in itself. By not allowing students to use resources during exams, instructors are encouraging them to develop this skill, which is essential in fields like software engineering where knowledge and tools are constantly evolving. In conclusion, while the intention behind open book exams may be to make learning easier, it can ultimately hinder students' ability to develop the skills and knowledge that are truly valuable in their future careers.","While it's true that having access to resources during exams can be beneficial, especially in fields like engineering where information is constantly evolving, it's essential to strike a balance between resource availability and knowledge retention. In the world of astronomy, where observatory personnel are often required to recall vast amounts of information, such as star catalogs, astronomical events, and celestial mechanics, the ability to recall this information without external reference is crucial. For instance, when monitoring a celestial event like a solar eclipse, astronomers must be able to quickly recall critical data, such as the timing, location, and duration of the eclipse, without having access to external resources. This ability to recall information under pressure is a critical skill that cannot be developed solely by relying on external resources during exams.

Moreover, allowing students to use resources during exams can create a false sense of security, where they become too reliant on external aids rather than internalizing the material. This can hinder their ability to think critically and make connections between different concepts, which are essential skills in any field, including engineering. In addition, relying too heavily on resources can also create a culture of cheating, where students feel that it's acceptable to use external resources to get by, rather than putting in the effort to truly understand the material.

Furthermore, the argument that open-book exams increase note-taking skills is not necessarily true. While note-taking is an essential skill, it's not the primary goal of learning. In fact, research has shown that students who focus on memorizing and internalizing information tend to perform better on exams, even when not allowed to use resources. This is because they have developed a deeper understanding of the material, which enables them to apply it in different contexts.

Ultimately, the goal of education should not be to make learning easier, but to equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in their chosen field. While open-book exams may seem like a convenient solution, they can ultimately undermine the very skills and knowledge that students need to develop in order to excel in their careers.","While the goal of learning is indeed to gain a deeper understanding of the material, relying solely on resources during exams can create a false sense of security and hinder the development of critical thinking skills. In the real world, professionals in the field are not given access to a library of resources when faced with a complex problem. They must be able to apply their knowledge and experience to solve the issue at hand, often under pressure and with limited time. By allowing students to use resources during exams, it may give them a temporary crutch, but it does not prepare them for the demands of a fast-paced and unpredictable industry. In the world of acting, for example, actors must be able to recall lines and character details from memory, as well as think on their feet to respond to unexpected cues or directions from the director. This requires a level of preparation, discipline, and retention that cannot be replicated by simply having access to a script or a resource. Furthermore, exams are not just about passing a test, but about demonstrating one's understanding and ability to apply knowledge in a real-world context. By not requiring students to recall information from memory, we may be depriving them of the opportunity to develop these essential skills. In a field like engineering, where professionals must often work under pressure and with limited resources, the ability to recall information from memory is a valuable asset that can mean the difference between success and failure. By not teaching students to rely on their own knowledge and memory, we may be putting them at a disadvantage in the long run. In addition, open-book exams can create a culture of dependency on resources, rather than promoting a culture of self-reliance and critical thinking. This can be particularly problematic in fields like engineering, where professionals must often work independently and make quick decisions based on their own knowledge and experience."
t3_6d2s8x,"expensive headphones are not worth the price in relation to cheap ones. I use headphones and earphones quite a lot. I always bought the cheap ones, and they used to break every 4 months or so. Although I bought some 20-ish Sony headphones for quite cheap 2.5 yrs ago and they're completely fine to this day. From a rAskReddit post, I've heard some really positive opinions about expensive headphones, but I still don't feel like I'm convinced. I'd want you guys to try and convince me that the expensive ones are worth buying. Money isn't really an issue, talk more about sound quality, comfort and durability. Thanks and may we have a nice debate.","Expensive headphones are not just a luxury item, but an investment in one's auditory experience. While it's true that cheaper headphones can provide a satisfactory listening experience for casual use, they often lack the nuances and depth that premium headphones offer. The Sony headphones you mentioned are a great example of a budget-friendly option that's surprisingly durable, but it's essential to consider the overall audio quality and how it compares to more expensive models. Research has shown that listeners can differentiate between higher-quality audio equipment and can pick up on subtle differences in sound that cheaper headphones often lack. For instance, a study by the Audio Engineering Society found that listeners could accurately detect a 10-15 difference in sound quality between high-end and budget headphones. This is not just a matter of personal preference, but a quantifiable difference that can enhance the listening experience. Furthermore, expensive headphones often come with advanced features such as active noise cancellation, customizable sound settings, and high-quality materials that can greatly improve comfort and immersion. These features can make a significant difference in prolonged listening sessions, especially for audiophiles who spend hours analyzing music. While money may not be an issue, it's essential to consider the long-term benefits of investing in high-quality headphones. A more precise and detailed soundstage, for example, can help listeners analyze music more effectively, and a more immersive experience can increase engagement and enjoyment. In the context of music analysis, high-quality headphones can be a valuable tool for uncovering patterns and trends in music charts and genre evolution. By investing in premium headphones, you can unlock new insights and a more engaging listening experience that can benefit both your personal enjoyment and professional analysis.","High-end headphones offer a depth of sound quality that cannot be replicated by cheaper alternatives, much like the intricate patterns on the wings of the majestic Queen Alexandra's Birdwing butterfly, which require a keen eye to appreciate. When studying the sounds of a rainforest, it's not just about distinguishing between different bird calls, but also about capturing the subtle nuances that reveal the ecosystem's intricate web of relationships. Similarly, high-end headphones can reveal the subtlest details in music, from the delicate creak of a bass note to the crystal-clear clarity of a vocalist's voice. These subtle nuances are not merely a matter of personal preference, but rather a reflection of the engineering that goes into crafting high-end headphones. Unlike cheaper alternatives that may break after a few months, high-end headphones are built to withstand the rigors of frequent use, just as a moth's exoskeleton protects it from the harsh conditions of its natural environment. The durability of high-end headphones is not just a guarantee of longevity, but also a testament to their ability to adapt to the demands of regular use. Furthermore, comfort plays a significant role in the overall listening experience, and high-end headphones are designed to provide a level of comfort that is comparable to a moth's ability to rest on a leaf without being disturbed. By investing in high-end headphones, one is not only investing in sound quality, but also in the long-term satisfaction and enjoyment that comes with it. In the grand scheme of things, the cost of high-end headphones is a small price to pay for the immersive auditory experience they provide, much like the cost of a research expedition to study a remote ecosystem is a small price to pay for the groundbreaking discoveries that can be made. When considering the value of high-end headphones, it's essential to think not just in terms of short-term savings, but in terms of the long-term benefits they provide, just as a moth's life cycle is not just a series of individual events, but a complex interplay of factors that ultimately shape its survival and success.","The notion that expensive headphones are not worth the price in relation to cheap ones may be a valid perspective for casual listeners, but it falls short for those who are deeply invested in music production and sound quality. When producing music, every detail counts, and high-quality headphones are essential for accurately capturing the nuances of the mix and mastering process. A good pair of headphones can make a significant difference in the way a song is perceived, allowing producers to refine their craft and create a more immersive experience for listeners. For instance, the difference between a flat frequency response and a accurate frequency response is stark, and it can make all the difference in the world when it comes to getting the perfect balance of bass, midrange, and treble. Furthermore, expensive headphones often come equipped with advanced drivers and materials that allow for a wider soundstage and better sound isolation, which can help producers pick out subtle details in the mix that might be lost in cheaper headphones. Comfort and durability are also crucial considerations, as prolonged listening sessions can be a regular occurrence for producers and engineers. Cheap headphones may be fine for casual listening, but they can be a hindrance when trying to focus on the intricacies of a mix. In contrast, high-end headphones can provide the comfort and support needed for long sessions, allowing producers to stay focused and deliver high-quality results. By investing in a good pair of headphones, producers can not only improve their craft but also expand their creative possibilities, unlocking new sonic landscapes and textures that might be lost with cheaper options. Ultimately, the value of high-quality headphones lies not just in their price tag but in the quality of the sound they produce and the creative possibilities they unlock. By considering the long-term benefits and the importance of accurate sound reproduction, it becomes clear that high-end headphones are a worthwhile investment for anyone serious about music production and sound quality.","The emphasis on durability in the original argument belies a broader issue of diminishing returns when it comes to cheap headphones. While it's true that some entry-level models may survive for several years without incident, this is far from universal, and many cheaper options will still break or suffer from poor quality control within a year or less. In contrast, high-end headphones are engineered with precision and crafted using top-tier materials, ensuring they can withstand repeated use and maintain their performance over an extended period. This not only provides users with peace of mind but also justifies the higher upfront cost as an investment in a long-lasting product that will continue to deliver exceptional sound quality for years to come. Moreover, when considering the opportunity costs associated with constantly replacing cheap headphones, it becomes clear that opting for high-end alternatives saves time and money in the long run.","The idea that expensive headphones are not worth the price implies a utilitarian view of consumer goods, where value is solely determined by function and immediate satisfaction. However, luxury items like high-end headphones often serve as status symbols, reflections of one's personal style, and expressions of artistic taste. In this context, their value lies not only in their technical capabilities but also in the emotional resonance they evoke. Furthermore, premium headphones frequently feature sleek designs that become conversation starters or fashion statements, reflecting a broader cultural significance beyond mere functionality. This intangible aspect of luxury goods should be taken into account when evaluating their worth, as it speaks to the unique experience and sense of identity that comes with owning a high-end product.","The notion that expensive headphones are not worth the price in relation to cheap ones is based on anecdotal evidence and a narrow focus on short-term cost-benefit analysis. However, when evaluating the value of luxury goods like high-end headphones, it's essential to consider their long-term implications and broader significance beyond mere utility. For instance, premium headphones often boast superior sound quality that can elevate one's listening experience, fostering deeper connections with music and expanding artistic appreciation. Moreover, these devices frequently feature advanced noise-cancellation technology, ergonomic design, and high-quality materials that ensure comfort during extended use periods. These benefits may not be immediately apparent to someone accustomed to cheap alternatives but become increasingly valuable over time. Furthermore, when weighed against the lifespan of a high-end headphone, which can easily exceed 10 years, their initial cost becomes a relatively minor investment compared to frequent replacements or upgrades with cheaper options. By considering these factors, it becomes clear that expensive headphones offer considerable value that transcends their upfront price tag."
t3_7eq78c,"The society is becoming ridiculously sensitive over the subject of gender identity. I am not touching on gender equality here - and just to be clear, to me both genders should be treated in equal way in all ways of life. I feel that the society is becoming increasingly sensitive on subject of gender identification - what gender people identify themselves with. This stems for all the various discussions and programs I see on TV, where some stories seem to me just ridiculous. Let me make one thing clear: if someone is born a manwoman, but feels more like an opposite sex, I can totally understand that. I don't see this as a ""condition"" or illness. They are who they are. Whether they decide to change gender or not, this is their life and entirely up to them. What bugs me is the talk of gender neutrality - how people are neither man or woman. And how there seems to be this movement to enforce the correct language in schools and society, and stop calling people boysgirls, manwoman. I man what the heck? We are a 2 gender species - male and female. There was nothing wrong with this for centuries, why is this becoming an issue now? What am I supposed to call a person I mean without ""fear"" of insulting them.... ""It""? I feel like this is being taken out of proportion, but I could be wrong. Feel free to try and Change My View.  the CMV moderators.","It is understandable that the notion of a two-gender binary seems natural, given its prevalence in modern society. However, a closer examination of historical records reveals that this binary has not always been the dominant understanding of gender identity. In medieval England, for instance, individuals who did not conform to traditional gender roles were often tolerated and even recognized as being of a different sex than their assigned one at birth. The existence of female hermits, who lived and worked as women but were assigned male sex at birth, highlights the complexity of gender identity in the past. Similarly, the recognition of intersex individuals, who were born with physical characteristics of both sexes, further challenges the idea that a two-gender binary has always been the norm. The historian would argue that societal norms and expectations surrounding gender have evolved over time and that our understanding of what it means to be male or female has been shaped by cultural, social, and historical contexts. The notion of gender neutrality is not a new concept, but rather a recognition of the diversity of human experiences that has been present throughout history. By studying the past, we can see that individuals have always existed on a spectrum of gender identities and expressions, and that the current movement towards greater recognition and acceptance is not a deviation from the norm, but rather a return to a more nuanced understanding of human experience. This perspective would encourage the reconsideration of the idea that a two-gender binary is the only natural and historical norm, and instead, recognize the complexity and diversity of human identity that has existed throughout history. It is essential to approach this issue with an open mind and a willingness to learn from the past, rather than relying on assumptions about what is natural or normal. The historian would also argue that the current movement towards greater recognition and acceptance of non-binary individuals is not about imposing a particular ideology, but rather about creating a more inclusive and compassionate society that values the diversity of human experience. By examining the past, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexity of human identity and the need for a more nuanced approach to gender recognition and expression.","The notion that society is becoming overly sensitive about gender identity is a misconception rooted in a misunderstanding of the complexities of human identity. The discussion surrounding gender neutrality is not about imposing a new set of rules or language, but rather about acknowledging and respecting the diversity of human experience. Inclusive language and policies that recognize the full spectrum of gender identities are essential for creating a society where everyone feels seen and valued. Research has shown that using inclusive language and respecting individuals' preferred pronouns can improve mental health outcomes, increase feelings of belonging, and even enhance academic performance.

In contrast, enforcing rigid gender binaries can have the opposite effect, perpetuating social divisions and marginalizing individuals who do not conform to traditional norms. For instance, studies have shown that students who are exposed to inclusive language and policies in schools report higher levels of self-esteem and academic engagement. Conversely, students who are exposed to transphobic or homophobic language and policies are more likely to experience bullying, mental health issues, and decreased academic performance. By promoting inclusive language and policies, we can create a more cohesive and equitable society that values diversity and promotes social cohesion.

The author's concern about not knowing how to refer to individuals who identify as non-binary is understandable, but it is a problem that can be easily addressed through education and awareness-raising. In fact, many institutions, including schools and businesses, have developed guidelines and resources to support individuals who use non-binary pronouns. By taking the time to learn and use respectful language, we can create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone. Furthermore, the benefits of inclusive language and policies extend beyond the individual, as they can also have a positive impact on community relationships and social cohesion.

In conclusion, the discussion surrounding gender neutrality is not about imposing a new set of rules or language, but rather about creating a society that values and respects the diversity of human experience. By promoting inclusive language and policies, we can create a more cohesive and equitable society that benefits everyone, regardless of their gender identity.","The notion that society is becoming overly sensitive about gender identity may stem from a misunderstanding of the importance of representation in the media. As a casting director, it's essential to recognize that authenticity in storytelling is what draws audiences in and makes a production memorable. The growing demand for inclusive casting and language is not about erasing traditional gender roles, but rather about acknowledging the diverse experiences and identities that exist within society. By embracing diverse casting, productions can tap into a broader talent pool, ensuring that stories are more relatable and engaging for a wider range of viewers. For instance, films like ""Moonlight"" and ""The Favourite"" have showcased the power of inclusive storytelling, winning critical acclaim and commercial success without compromising artistic integrity. These productions prove that sensitivity towards gender identity is not a hindrance, but a key to unlocking more compelling and authentic narratives. In the industry, the use of inclusive language is not about fear of offending, but about creating a safe and respectful environment for all individuals, including those who don't identify as strictly male or female. In fact, the use of theythem pronouns, for example, is not a new concept, but rather a recognition of the complexity of human experience. By embracing this complexity, productions can create characters that resonate with a broader audience, leading to more nuanced and engaging storytelling. The casting director's primary goal is to find the right actor for the role, not to impose a narrow definition of gender on them. In fact, many actors, regardless of their gender identity, have expressed gratitude for the opportunity to play characters that reflect their own experiences, leading to more authentic and impactful performances. Ultimately, the growing sensitivity around gender identity is not a threat, but an opportunity for the industry to evolve and become more inclusive, allowing for a wider range of voices and perspectives to be heard.","The argument against the growing sensitivity around gender identity issues relies heavily on an outdated understanding of sex and gender as fixed, binary categories. However, this view fails to account for advances in medical science, anthropology, and sociology that have consistently shown that human biology is more nuanced and varied than once thought. Sex assigned at birth is not a reliable indicator of a person's gender identity or expression; many individuals possess characteristics that do not fit neatly into traditional malefemale categories. Furthermore, the concept of ""gender neutrality"" is often mischaracterized as a rejection of all gender distinctions rather than an attempt to create space for non-binary and trans identities within existing social structures. Language plays a crucial role in shaping cultural attitudes toward different groups; using inclusive language sends a powerful message that trans and non-binary individuals are valued, respected members of society. This is not about ""taking things out of proportion"" but about acknowledging the profound impact that language can have on people's lives.","The concern that enforcing inclusive language in schools and society will lead to confusion or disruption stems from an overly simplistic view of human communication. In reality, language has always been a dynamic system capable of adapting to new experiences, contexts, and perspectives. The evolution of language is driven by social and cultural needs; it expands and contracts as our understanding of the world changes. Rather than clinging to outdated terms like ""boys"" or ""girls,"" which may have once served their purpose but now perpetuate harm for some individuals, society can benefit from embracing a more inclusive vocabulary that reflects the diversity of human experience. This is not about imposing artificial constraints on speech but about recognizing the power of language to build empathy and understanding across differences. By engaging with trans and non-binary perspectives and using respectful language, individuals can participate in creating a culture that values everyone's identity and promotes greater social cohesion.","The notion that society is becoming ""ridiculously sensitive"" over gender identity issues overlooks the long history of marginalization and oppression faced by individuals whose gender identities do not align with their assigned sex at birth. The struggles of trans people are rooted in centuries of systemic violence, exclusion, and silencing, which have had devastating consequences for their mental health, well-being, and access to basic human rights. By dismissing the importance of language in this context, one risks perpetuating further marginalization and erasure. Gender identity is not a fixed or binary concept; it exists on a spectrum that varies across cultures, individuals, and experiences. To acknowledge this complexity is not to abandon traditional notions of gender but to broaden our understanding of human diversity. The push for inclusive language in schools and society is aimed at creating a more welcoming environment for trans youth, who are disproportionately vulnerable to bullying, mental health issues, and suicidal ideation. By using person-first language (""person with a trans identity"" rather than ""trans person"") or opting for more neutral pronouns like theythem, individuals can express respect and solidarity without having to conform to rigid expectations of what it means to be male or female. This is not about imposing a new norm but about recognizing that people's experiences are valid and deserving of validation."
t3_7mxhsy,"Healthcare is a right, not a good, and should be free at the point of use An argument against this is that having too much state provision makes us complacent, stops us from working hard, and takes away incentives to take responsibility for one's own health. However, I believe that healthcare allows people to maintain the basic strength and functionality to be productive and take responsibility for building their own life. Many health problems are not due to lifestyle factors, and we should not deny someone the ability to be a healthy member of society just because they lack the economic means to do so. This actually means we have fewer productive members of society. Many Libertarians believe we should not have such state provisions, as individuals should have low taxes and the right to choose what they do and how they spend their money. However, what if one needs medical care in order to have choices in their life, but they cannot afford it? I hold the same view about most basic state provisions, but using healthcare as an example makes my view easier to explain.","The argument that healthcare is a right, not a good, overlooks the complex interplay between social welfare policies and party dynamics. In countries with robust social safety nets, parties that emphasize social welfare policies tend to perform well electorally, particularly among low-income voters and younger generations. By framing healthcare as a right, these parties can tap into the deep-seated desire for security and equality that resonates with these demographic groups. However, this framing also risks alienating more affluent voters who prioritize individual freedom and limited government intervention. In the United States, for example, the Affordable Care Act, which expanded healthcare coverage to millions of Americans, was a key factor in the Democratic Party's electoral success in 2008 and 2012. By contrast, the Republican Party's repeal efforts in 2017 were widely unpopular, especially among low-income voters. A shift towards a more libertarian approach to healthcare, emphasizing individual responsibility and limited government intervention, could potentially erode the Democratic Party's base and create opportunities for more conservative parties to gain ground. Furthermore, the emphasis on individual responsibility and limited government intervention may not be as effective in mobilizing voters in the long term, as voters are more likely to respond to policies that provide tangible benefits and security. In addition, the lack of a robust social safety net can exacerbate health disparities and undermine public health outcomes, ultimately harming the very individuals that a libertarian approach aims to empower. By prioritizing individual responsibility over collective provision, a libertarian approach to healthcare may inadvertently create a self-reinforcing cycle of inequality and poor health outcomes. A more nuanced approach that balances individual freedom with social welfare policies may be more effective in promoting public health and electoral success for left-leaning parties.","The notion that healthcare should be free at the point of use is often rooted in a desire to create a more equitable society, but it may inadvertently create a culture of dependency rather than promoting self-reliance. In the film industry, for instance, talented individuals from all walks of life can rise to prominence with the right opportunities. However, if the state assumes full responsibility for healthcare, it may inadvertently undermine the very notion of meritocracy that drives artistic innovation. Without the burden of medical expenses, individuals may not develop the resilience and resourcefulness needed to navigate the challenges of their craft, ultimately stifling their creative potential. Moreover, over-reliance on state-funded healthcare could distract from the real issue at hand: ensuring that individuals from diverse backgrounds have equal access to opportunities and resources to pursue their passions. A more targeted approach would be to provide support for those who genuinely require it, rather than creating a blanket system that benefits everyone, regardless of need. This could include subsidies for low-income artists, education and training programs, and partnerships with healthcare providers to offer reduced rates for industry professionals. By doing so, the film industry can promote a culture of self-reliance, meritocracy, and innovation, ultimately leading to a more vibrant and representative industry.","The notion that universal healthcare would lead to complacency and undermine individual responsibility overlooks the historical precedent of communal healthcare systems in medieval England. In fact, the village-based healthcare systems of the Middle Ages demonstrate that shared provision of healthcare can foster a sense of community and social cohesion, ultimately leading to increased productivity and well-being. The historian notes that in medieval villages, healthcare was often provided through communal efforts, with neighbors and family members caring for one another in times of illness or injury. This arrangement not only ensured that everyone had access to basic care but also created a sense of mutual responsibility and solidarity among community members.

Moreover, the historian would argue that the idea of individuals being solely responsible for their own health is a relatively modern concept, and one that is not supported by historical evidence. In medieval times, healthcare was often seen as a communal good, and individuals who were unable to work due to illness or injury were not stigmatized or marginalized. Instead, they were cared for by their communities, allowing them to recover and eventually return to productive roles within society. The historian suggests that this approach not only promoted social cohesion but also ensured that everyone had the opportunity to contribute to their communities, rather than being left behind due to lack of access to healthcare.

Furthermore, the historian would contend that the notion of healthcare as a right, not a good, is not mutually exclusive with individual responsibility. In fact, a universal healthcare system can actually empower individuals to take greater control over their own health by providing them with access to preventive care, early interventions, and treatment options. By removing the financial burdens associated with healthcare, individuals are free to focus on their overall well-being, rather than struggling to afford basic medical care. This, in turn, can lead to a more productive and resilient society, where individuals are better equipped to take care of themselves and their communities.

In conclusion, the historian would argue that the historical precedent of communal healthcare systems in medieval England suggests that universal healthcare can actually foster a more productive and resilient society, rather than undermining individual responsibility. By providing access to basic care, universal healthcare can empower individuals to take control of their own health, contribute to their communities, and lead more fulfilling lives.","The argument that state-provided healthcare creates complacency is based on a narrow understanding of human motivation and the role of government in society. In reality, many people work hard to support their families or contribute to the economy despite struggling with health issues, often at great personal cost. The notion that making healthcare free would somehow undermine these efforts is unfounded and dismissive of the complex challenges faced by working-class individuals. Moreover, the idea that individuals should be solely responsible for their own health care overlooks the significant impact that systemic barriers have on access to quality medical care. In countries with universal healthcare systems, people are more likely to engage in preventive care, adhere to treatment plans, and experience better health outcomes overall. Rather than creating complacency, state-provided healthcare can actually empower individuals to take control of their own health by providing them with the resources they need to navigate complex healthcare systems.","The concern that making healthcare a right would lead to overutilization or misallocation of resources is often overstated and based on outdated assumptions about human behavior. In reality, many countries with universal healthcare systems have successfully implemented cost-containment measures, such as negotiated rates for services, quality-based payment reforms, and public health initiatives to promote preventive care. These strategies can help ensure that resources are allocated in a way that prioritizes the most effective treatments and promotes good health outcomes. Furthermore, research has shown that having a universal healthcare system does not lead to an increase in frivolous or unnecessary medical procedures, but rather a reduction in avoidable hospitalizations and emergency department visits. In fact, countries with strong public healthcare systems tend to have better population health metrics overall, including lower rates of infant mortality, premature death, and chronic disease. By prioritizing the well-being of all citizens, governments can actually reduce long-term costs associated with medical care by addressing health disparities and promoting preventive care from an early age.","The notion that making healthcare free at the point of use will somehow motivate individuals to work harder or take more responsibility for their health is a misguided assumption. Research has shown that people's behaviors and motivations are not solely driven by economic incentives, but rather by complex factors such as social norms, education, and access to resources. Furthermore, many individuals who rely on state-provided healthcare do so due to circumstances beyond their control, such as chronic illnesses or disabilities, which cannot be simply 'cured' by working harder or being more responsible. Moreover, the idea that people are somehow less likely to engage in healthy behaviors if they don't have a financial stake in doing so is not supported by empirical evidence. In reality, many individuals who lack access to healthcare due to cost barriers often struggle to maintain good health and may experience worsening conditions as a result of delayed or foregone medical care. A more effective approach to promoting public health might involve addressing the root causes of health disparities, such as poverty, education, and environmental factors, rather than placing blame on individuals for not working harder."
t3_69p4a2,"I believe that kids should be able to take an off year (5-12 grade)if they feel they need a break. Lots of kids, especially in high school are often stressed with everything going on in their lives. I can speak from experience that having social issues, school work and sports can all be a big weight in the life of a 14-18 year old. I believe that if a kid needs they should be able to take an off year and relax instead of having to deal with all of this stress at once with no break or time to calm down. While it should be regulated to 1 or 2 years per kid, I think it would make a huge difference in the stress levels of teenagers. It would also lower the percent of kids with anxiety and help with school work, as the kids will be able to actually learn the information instead of being overpowered with schoolwork, and having no downtime to actually soak in what they have learned. 25 of teens have some sort of anxiety. It is also shown in college student athletes that taking a gap year between high school and college actually lowers anxiety as well as the risk for burnout. Burnout is what occurs when somebody does an activitely so much and so actively that they start to see that activity as a burden on them and can start to develop depression and lethargy. Burnout is something that affects many people, especially student athletes and giving kids the ability to take a year off might help eliminate this problem easier. The only problem I see is that a kid might use both of their years in a row just to abuse it and then when they actually need to take a break they don't have the years to use and suffer from anxiety","The idea of an ""off year"" policy, although well-intentioned, may not be the most effective solution to addressing the complex issues of stress, anxiety, and burnout among high school students. Implementing such a policy could potentially create more problems than it solves, particularly for students who may not utilize the year productively or who may struggle to reintegrate into the academic environment upon their return. For instance, students who take an off year may find themselves at a disadvantage when they return to school, having missed out on essential foundational courses, and may require additional support to catch up, potentially leading to further stress and anxiety. Furthermore, this policy may inadvertently create a culture of avoidance, where students view taking a year off as a viable solution to their academic struggles, rather than seeking help and support while still enrolled in school. Moreover, the policy's effectiveness would be difficult to monitor and regulate, especially in cases where students may not have a clear plan or goals for their off year. In contrast, schools and counselors can offer a more targeted and structured approach to supporting students, such as flexible scheduling, mental health resources, and academic accommodations, which can be tailored to meet the individual needs of each student. By investing in these types of support systems, schools can create a more inclusive and supportive environment that promotes student well-being and academic success without creating unnecessary gaps in a student's education. Additionally, schools can also explore alternative models, such as online or part-time programs, that allow students to take a break from the traditional full-time academic environment without sacrificing their educational progress. The goal should be to create a holistic approach that addresses the root causes of stress and anxiety, rather than simply providing a temporary escape from academic responsibilities. By doing so, we can empower students to develop resilience, coping skills, and a growth mindset that will serve them well throughout their academic and professional careers.","While it's understandable that the proposal to allow students to take an off year stems from a genuine concern for their well-being and the alleviation of stress, a closer examination of the idea reveals several potential drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. For instance, an off year might hinder students' ability to adapt to the increasingly complex and rapidly changing world they will face upon graduation. In the natural world, species that fail to adapt and evolve often become extinct, highlighting the importance of resilience and flexibility in the face of adversity. Similarly, students who opt for an off year may find it difficult to readjust to the demands of education and the workforce, potentially leading to a lack of preparedness and a diminished ability to compete in a global market. Furthermore, the proposed measure could have unintended consequences, such as creating a two-tiered education system where students who take an off year gain an unfair advantage over their peers. This could lead to social and economic disparities, undermining the fundamental principles of equality and fairness. Moreover, the notion that an off year would alleviate anxiety and stress among students is based on anecdotal evidence, particularly the case of college student athletes. However, it's crucial to consider that the experiences of student athletes may not be representative of the broader student population, and that the benefits of an off year may not be universally applicable. In addition, there are alternative solutions that can be implemented to reduce stress and anxiety among students, such as flexible scheduling, counseling services, and academic support programs. These measures can be tailored to meet the diverse needs of students and provide a more comprehensive approach to addressing their well-being. Rather than adopting a blanket policy that may have far-reaching and unpredictable consequences, it would be more prudent to focus on these targeted interventions that have been proven to be effective in reducing stress and anxiety. By doing so, educators and policymakers can create a more supportive learning environment that fosters the development of well-rounded individuals who are equipped to thrive in an ever-changing world.","While the idea of providing an off-year option for students may seem appealing, particularly in light of the growing concerns about student stress and anxiety, it is essential to consider the broader implications of such a policy. Historically, alternative education systems have often been implemented with the intention of providing students with greater flexibility and autonomy, but they have also been criticized for creating gaps in academic preparation and perpetuating social and economic disparities. In the case of a universal off-year option, it is likely that students who are already at a disadvantage would be disproportionately affected, exacerbating existing inequalities. Furthermore, the potential benefits of an off-year, such as reduced stress and anxiety, may not be universally applicable, and some students may find that the break serves as a temporary distraction from their academic and personal challenges, rather than a meaningful solution.

Moreover, the notion that students can simply take a break from the pressures of school and return refreshed and rejuvenated is overly simplistic. Research has shown that students who take gap years often return to school with a sense of accomplishment and motivation, but they also often face significant challenges in readjusting to the academic rigor and expectations of their previous school. In addition, an off-year policy would require significant changes to the way schools are funded, staffed, and structured, which could have far-reaching consequences for students, teachers, and the broader community. Rather than advocating for a universal off-year option, educators and policymakers should focus on creating more nuanced and targeted solutions that address the root causes of student stress and anxiety, such as providing more support for mental health resources, flexible scheduling, and personalized learning plans.","The notion that a year-long break from school would alleviate stress and anxiety in teenagers is intriguing, but it overlooks the potential consequences of extended periods away from academic rigor. Research has shown that students who take gap years often struggle to reintegrate into their previous academic environment, leading to decreased motivation and engagement upon returning. Moreover, the lack of structure and accountability during a year-long break can hinder personal growth and development, as individuals may not have access to resources or support systems that help them stay on track with their goals and aspirations. Furthermore, relying solely on an off-year solution might lead to students missing out on critical developmental experiences, such as extracurricular activities, internships, and mentorship opportunities that can foster essential life skills. A more effective approach may be to provide additional support services within the existing academic framework, such as counseling, academic advising, and mental health resources. This way, students can receive targeted assistance without sacrificing their educational momentum.","The original argument implies that an off-year would allow students to focus on their mental health and well-being without sacrificing academic momentum. However, this assumption may not hold true in practice. Students who take an off-year may still be required to meet graduation requirements or adhere to specific coursework standards, which can create a sense of stress and pressure even during what is meant to be a break. Furthermore, the decision to take an off-year should not be taken lightly, as it can have far-reaching consequences for students' academic and professional prospects. Rather than providing a blanket solution that applies to all students, schools might consider adopting more nuanced approaches, such as flexible scheduling, part-time programs, or online courses that allow students to balance their needs with academic responsibilities. By offering tailored support rather than a one-size-fits-all solution, educators can help students navigate the challenges of adolescence while maintaining momentum towards their educational goals.","While it is true that many teenagers experience anxiety, viewing an off-year as a silver bullet solution might oversimplify the complexities of adolescent development. Anxiety is often intertwined with other issues, such as social pressures, academic expectations, and family dynamics, which cannot be addressed solely through a year-long break from school. Moreover, students who choose to take an off-year may not necessarily have a clear plan or direction for their time away, which can lead to feelings of aimlessness and purposelessness. In contrast, structured programs that integrate mental health support with academic activities, such as online courses or vocational training, might be more effective in promoting healthy habits and academic progress. By addressing the root causes of anxiety rather than treating it as a standalone issue, educators can create a more comprehensive support system for students."
t3_v9xirf,"Rhythm games are pretty easy compared to other game genres So I did actually play a bit of rhythm games in the past (Cytus and a little bit of mania) but I didn't really get hooked. I think it and the genre itself was,,, forgiving and not really challenging (?) since if you want to do good in a certain level, you just have to get used to it, repeat and practice, and that's it. This skill will deliver to other levels because you're already used to it and it will feel easier the time goes on, compared to game genres like FPS, MOBA, RTS, etc where each game is actually different and you have to act accordingly and adjust is much more difficult. I think the only section where rhythm games are actually difficult is reaction time, like speed and execution? But that's primarily it. Also, rhythm games do actually get easier the more experience you have even if you play a different game with different mechanics (as said by my friend who plays rhythm games a lot). But yeah, at some extent, this is kinda true right? I want to be open-minded about this because I recently debated and argued with a certain someone who is good at rhythm games and don't play the same genres I do, and I realized I was being too close minded.","Rhythm games, despite their seemingly repetitive nature, offer a depth and complexity that is often overlooked. The argument that rhythm games are easy because they can be mastered through repetition and practice overlooks the intricate patterns, timing, and execution required to excel in these games. The skillset developed through rhythm games, such as fine-tuned timing and spatial awareness, can be applied to other genres that require quick reflexes and coordination, such as action games or fighting games. For instance, the ability to anticipate and respond to musical cues in rhythm games can translate to anticipating and reacting to enemy attacks in action games.

Moreover, the challenge of rhythm games lies not only in reaction time but also in developing muscle memory and fine-tuning one's sense of rhythm. As a gamer familiar with historical warfare strategy games, it's essential to recognize that even the most complex strategies require a deep understanding of timing and coordination. The intricate dance of cavalry charges, artillery deployments, and infantry maneuvers in historical battles demands a similar level of timing and coordination as rhythm games. The ability to anticipate and respond to the ebb and flow of battle is a fundamental aspect of strategy, and rhythm games can help develop this critical thinking skill.

Furthermore, the notion that rhythm games get easier with experience is not unique to this genre. Many games, including those in the strategy genre, offer a sense of progression and mastery as players develop their skills and adapt to new challenges. However, this does not diminish the complexity and challenge of the game; rather, it highlights the player's growing expertise. In the case of rhythm games, the increasing difficulty and complexity of songs and levels require a similar level of adaptability and strategic thinking as other genres. The difference lies in the type of challenge, not the level of challenge itself. By recognizing the value of rhythm games and their ability to develop strategic thinking and timing, game designers can draw inspiration from this genre to create more engaging and challenging experiences for players across various genres.","The assertion that rhythm games are easy compared to other genres is a misconception rooted in a superficial understanding of the challenges involved. While it is true that repetition and practice can lead to improved performance in rhythm games, this does not necessarily mean that the genre is lacking in depth or complexity. In fact, the precision and timing required in rhythm games can be likened to the nuanced and coordinated movements of a naval crew executing a complex tactical maneuver. Each musician or player must work together seamlessly, anticipating and adapting to the changing tempo and rhythm to achieve success.

Furthermore, the concept of reaction time and speed in rhythm games is not merely a matter of muscle memory, but rather a carefully honed skill that requires attention to detail and a deep understanding of the game mechanics. The historian can relate to this concept through the example of a ship's crew responding to a sudden change in circumstances, such as a shift in wind direction or an unexpected enemy attack. In both cases, quick reflexes and adaptability are crucial to avoid disaster. The complexity of these situations cannot be reduced to mere repetition and practice, but rather requires a deep understanding of the underlying systems and the ability to think critically and respond accordingly.

Moreover, the historian would argue that the genre's ability to deliver a sense of progression and improvement is a testament to its complexity, as players must continually adapt to new challenges and difficulties. The idea that rhythm games get easier as experience increases is not necessarily a sign of a lack of challenge, but rather a demonstration of the player's growing proficiency and ability to handle more complex rhythms and patterns. This parallels the way a skilled naval commander must adapt to new situations and opponents, using their experience and knowledge to stay one step ahead. By recognizing the parallels between rhythm games and naval warfare, one can begin to appreciate the depth and complexity of the genre, and understand that the challenges it presents are not so different from those faced by naval crews in the heat of battle.","While it is true that rhythm games may not require the same level of physical dexterity as action-packed genres like FPS or MOBA, this does not necessarily make them easy. In fact, rhythm games demand a unique set of skills that are just as challenging to master as those required in other genres. For instance, the ability to anticipate and react to complex musical patterns, the capacity to adapt to changing rhythms and time signatures, and the skill to coordinate hand movements with auditory cues are all critical components of successful rhythm game play. These demands are reminiscent of the intricate adaptations found in the natural world, where species have evolved to respond to specific environmental cues, such as the timing of seasonal changes or the presence of predators.

Furthermore, the idea that rhythm games become easier with practice and repetition is a misconception. While it is true that repetition can facilitate muscle memory and improve performance, it does not necessarily translate to ease. In fact, rhythm games often require a high degree of situational awareness, which can be challenging to develop and maintain, especially when faced with complex levels and challenging songs. The entomologist's own experience with moth taxonomy and biogeography has taught them the importance of context and nuance in understanding complex systems, and they believe that rhythm games share similar characteristics.

The comparison between rhythm games and other genres is also misplaced. While it is true that each level in an FPS or MOBA may present a unique challenge, the underlying mechanics and strategies remain relatively consistent. In contrast, rhythm games often involve a wide range of musical styles, time signatures, and difficulty levels, making each game a distinct challenge that requires a unique set of skills and strategies. This diversity and complexity are hallmarks of the natural world, where species have evolved to adapt to a wide range of environments and ecological niches.

In conclusion, while rhythm games may not require the same level of physical dexterity as other genres, they demand a unique set of skills and strategies that are just as challenging to master. By recognizing the complexity and nuance of rhythm games, we can appreciate the depth and richness of this genre, and challenge the notion that they are inherently easy.","The argument that other genres like FPS, MOBA, and RTS are inherently more challenging because each game requires unique skills and adaptations may be overstated. While it's true that each game within these genres presents distinct challenges, players can still develop a broad range of transferable skills across multiple games. For example, a skilled FPS player can apply their reaction time, spatial awareness, and decision-making abilities to other first-person shooters or even rhythm games that require similar reflexes. Similarly, MOBA players can leverage their understanding of strategy, resource management, and team coordination to excel in other competitive multiplayer environments. By focusing solely on the differences between genres, one overlooks the commonalities in player skills and adaptability that transcend specific game types.","The notion that rhythm games are inherently easy compared to other genres overlooks the complexity and nuances within this genre. Rhythm games require a unique blend of timing, pattern recognition, and cognitive processing that can be challenging in its own right. For instance, mastering a difficult song in Cytus demands a high level of accuracy and consistency over an extended period, which is no trivial feat. Moreover, rhythm games often involve intricate button-mashing patterns, tempo changes, and unexpected surprises, all of which necessitate quick reflexes and adaptability. In fact, research has shown that playing music games can improve cognitive skills such as attention, memory, and processing speed, making them a valuable tool for gamers seeking to develop these abilities. Furthermore, the experience curve in rhythm games is not simply about repetition and practice; it requires an understanding of the game's mechanics, anticipation of upcoming patterns, and strategic decision-making. This level of complexity is often overlooked when dismissing rhythm games as easy or shallow.","The notion that rhythm games become easier over time due to muscle memory and repetition may be an oversimplification of the learning process involved in these games. While it's true that experienced players can develop a high level of proficiency, this doesn't necessarily mean that the challenges within the game decrease. Rather, skilled players often learn to navigate complex patterns, anticipate upcoming difficulties, and refine their timing and decision-making skills to tackle increasingly demanding content. In fact, many rhythm games feature expert modes or special difficulties specifically designed for experienced players who have mastered the base game mechanics. These advanced levels often require an even higher level of precision, strategy, and creativity than earlier stages, making it clear that the challenges within rhythm games can deepen rather than diminish with time."
t3_y1i7ki,"We should stop segregating restrooms and just have singular gender-neutral bathrooms in public spaces. I've been thinking about it, and I can't think of a good reason for public restrooms to be segregated by gender or sex. Public restrooms should just have floor-to-ceiling individual stalls for people to use. Such bathrooms would be no more dangerous for sexual assaults than any other public area. No one is actually naked when using the restroom, and having floor-to-ceiling stalls would give everyone complete privacy when doing their ""business."" Basically any argument of this leading to ""women getting raped or crept on by men"" just seems so outdated to me, and seemingly dismisses any possible sexual assaults or predatory behavior against men by other men in the current bathroom setup. Having just one genderneutral bathroom would also protect them. Also think it could raise accountability for people to keep things clean. (coughspecifically talking about men who trash stalls from my own personal experiencescough)
You can CMV by providing a valid reason to keep having segregated bathrooms in society. 
Sorry, I need to clarify my position because I already changed my original view somewhat. Clearly, if implemented this would cause parts of society to freak out and have a lot of issuesbacklash adjusting to it. People have CMV of actually implementing such a system today, however still curious about any real reasons why bathrooms should be segregated, apart from tradition.","The assumption that a single gender-neutral bathroom would be no more susceptible to sexual assaults than any other public area overlooks the role of biology and human behavior. Research has shown that women are generally smaller and weaker than men, making them more vulnerable to physical attack in tight spaces like bathrooms. Additionally, the presence of an individual from the opposite sex in a restroom can trigger feelings of unease or anxiety, particularly if the user feels they cannot trust their safety or privacy. By segregating bathrooms by sex, individuals are given a safe space to address their bodily needs without fear of harassment or assault, which is essential for maintaining dignity and bodily autonomy.","The idea of a single gender-neutral bathroom in public spaces is often touted as a progressive move towards inclusivity and equality. However, this perspective overlooks the fundamental difference between men's and women's experiences, particularly when it comes to issues like safety and dignity. For instance, women are disproportionately victims of harassment and assault in public restrooms, with some studies suggesting that up to 70 of women have experienced some form of harassment or threat while using a public restroom. In contrast, the risks associated with men using such facilities are relatively lower. Furthermore, the notion that floor-to-ceiling stalls would provide complete privacy for users is misleading - individuals may still feel uncomfortable or vulnerable when sharing a bathroom space with members of the opposite sex, especially in situations where they require assistance or have personal hygiene issues.","While the idea of accountability for cleanliness in public restrooms may seem appealing, it is unlikely that having single gender-neutral facilities would achieve this goal. In reality, issues with cleanliness often stem from a lack of proper maintenance, inadequate waste disposal systems, or simply a disregard for personal hygiene practices. Segregating bathrooms by sex also provides an opportunity to implement more effective cleaning protocols and resource allocation, such as designating certain hours or days for each restroom's use based on user preferences. Furthermore, men and women often have different expectations when it comes to bathroom cleanliness, with some studies indicating that women place a higher priority on hygiene in public restrooms than their male counterparts.","The proposal to abolish sex-segregated restrooms in public spaces may seem like a progressive and inclusive step, but it overlooks the complexity of human psychology and the social dynamics at play in these spaces. The assumption that a single, gender-neutral bathroom would eliminate the risk of sexual assault is overly optimistic and ignores the fact that perpetrators of such crimes often target vulnerable individuals in areas where they can easily isolate and exploit them. Moreover, the notion that individuals would not feel uncomfortable or anxious using a bathroom with people of the opposite sex is a simplistic view, particularly for those who have experienced trauma related to public restrooms. For some individuals, the idea of sharing a bathroom with others of the opposite sex can evoke feelings of vulnerability, anxiety, or even fear.

Furthermore, the idea that a single bathroom would promote accountability for cleanliness is a flawed assumption, as individuals may still feel uncomfortable reporting or addressing issues of messiness or disruption in such a shared space. In fact, the lack of clear boundaries and expectations in a gender-neutral bathroom could lead to increased tension and conflict among users, rather than greater cooperation and mutual respect. Additionally, the notion that men would be more responsible for cleaning up after themselves in a shared bathroom is an unfair assumption, as it places an undue burden on one group to police the behavior of others. This approach also fails to acknowledge that individuals from all backgrounds and identities can be responsible for maintaining cleanliness and respecting shared spaces.

Another concern is that the abolition of sex-segregated restrooms could disproportionately affect certain populations, such as young children, individuals with disabilities, or those from cultures where traditional gender roles are deeply ingrained. These individuals may feel uncomfortable or even traumatized by the idea of using a bathroom with people of the opposite sex, and may require accommodations that are not currently being considered. The psychologist's role is not to dismiss the potential benefits of a more inclusive bathroom policy, but to highlight the need for a more nuanced and evidence-based approach that takes into account the diverse experiences and needs of all individuals. By considering the potential unintended consequences of such a drastic change, policymakers can work towards creating a more inclusive and respectful public restroom environment that meets the needs of all users.","While the idea of having singular, floor-to-ceiling stalls in public restrooms may seem appealing, it neglects the complex historical and social contexts that have led to the segregation of bathrooms. For decades, women have been subjected to higher rates of harassment and assault in shared spaces, and the creation of single-sex bathrooms has been a crucial step towards their safety and dignity. The notion that women are not vulnerable to assault in public restrooms is overly simplistic and dismissive of the reality faced by many individuals. In fact, the presence of single-sex bathrooms has been shown to reduce the likelihood of harassment and assault by providing a safe space for women to use the restroom without fear of unwanted attention.

Moreover, the implementation of a single-gender bathroom system would likely have a disproportionate impact on marginalized groups, such as transgender individuals, who often face significant barriers when accessing bathrooms that align with their gender identity. The lack of separate facilities for transgender individuals could exacerbate feelings of marginalization and exclusion, perpetuating the very social problems that the author seeks to address. Furthermore, people with disabilities may also be negatively impacted by the abolition of segregated bathrooms, as they may require specific facilities, such as accessible stalls or diaper-changing areas, that are not typically available in mixed-gender bathrooms.

In addition to these concerns, the sociologist would argue that the notion of accountability for cleanliness may be a red herring. While men may be more likely to litter or neglect to clean up after themselves in public restrooms, this is not a reason to abandon the existing system, but rather an opportunity to address the underlying social norms and expectations that contribute to this behavior. By keeping segregated bathrooms, we can focus on education and outreach efforts to promote responsible behavior and create a culture of respect and inclusivity, rather than risking the well-being and safety of vulnerable individuals. Ultimately, the abolition of segregated bathrooms would be a simplistic and potentially damaging solution to a complex social problem, and would require a more nuanced and evidence-based approach to address the needs of all individuals, particularly those who are most vulnerable.","While the idea of singular, floor-to-ceiling stalls in public restrooms may seem progressive and inclusive, it is essential to consider the nuances of human behavior and the complexities of implementing such a system. One potential issue is the lack of clear communication and boundaries in a shared, unisex environment. In some cultures, individuals may not feel comfortable using a restroom that does not align with their assigned sex at birth, and may avoid using the facility altogether, leading to feelings of exclusion and marginalization. Furthermore, the absence of clear signage and expectations can create ambiguity, which may be exploited by individuals with malicious intentions.

Additionally, the notion that having separate restrooms by sex is outdated and dismissive of potential assaults on men by other men is a misconception. In reality, sexual harassment and assault are issues that affect individuals of all genders, and separating restrooms by sex does not provide a foolproof solution. In fact, many people, regardless of their gender, may feel uncomfortable using a restroom where they are not the dominant sex, which can lead to increased anxiety and stress.

Moreover, while individual stalls with floor-to-ceiling partitions may provide some level of privacy, they may not address the issue of people leaving their belongings unattended or leaving the stall unclean. In situations where there are no clear expectations or consequences for maintaining cleanliness, some individuals may take advantage of this lack of accountability, creating an unpleasant experience for others. This is not to say that current restroom arrangements are perfect, but rather that introducing a new system without considering these potential pitfalls could exacerbate existing problems.

It is also worth considering the logistical challenges of implementing such a system, particularly in areas with limited space or resources. Retrofitting existing restrooms to accommodate floor-to-ceiling stalls may be costly and impractical, which could lead to a lack of accessible facilities for people with disabilities or those who rely on restrooms for specific needs. In contrast, maintaining separate restrooms by sex can provide a clear and straightforward solution that prioritizes inclusivity while also respecting individual comfort levels and needs."
t3_umdvo0,"Kathy Griffin should have been banned from Twitter I was having an argument with somebody close to me that is extremely conservative, and we began talking about conservatives being banned from Twitter. I am all for people being banned for misinformation and fomenting violence. I am glad Trump got banned, same with Steve Bannon's crazy ass calling for people to be beheaded. I brought up these points and they retorted by mentioning that Kathy Griffin was not banned for similar violations. I shot back that she got fired from CNN's New years show with Anderson Cooper, and her tweets were flagged, but I am not sure if that was enough. Holding trump's severed head and then going on to suggest that Trump should inject himself with a syringe with nothing but hot air, which could kill him, seems like it's inciting violence to me. It is basically saying, I want this person to die, which may encourage nutters to make it happen. As much as I wanted to retort with claims of whataboutism, something in me kept thinking that she really did get a pass. And that even though the right loves whataboutism and loves to complain about liberal bias even when there is none, I suspect that this really was a case of bias and a double standard. And I know that twitter is entitled to have double standards, they are a private company and they can do whatever they want, but I think they should have a level of consistency. Ban those right wing nutters when they post violent stuff, but the same should go for a liberal like Kathy Griffin as well.","The argument that Kathy Griffin should have been banned from Twitter for her holding a fake severed head of Trump is not entirely convincing, especially when compared to the treatment of Trump and Bannon. While Griffin's tweet was undoubtedly provocative and tasteless, it is essential to consider the context and intent behind her actions. Her intention was to mock Trump and his brand of politics, not to incite violence. Unlike Trump's tweets, which were perceived as a genuine threat by many, Griffin's message was clearly satirical and aimed at critiquing the Trump administration's policies rather than promoting harm.

Moreover, the comparison to Trump's own incendiary tweets is flawed because it overlooks the critical difference in their impact. Trump's tweets have been shown to have a direct impact on his base, often amplifying his supporters' anger and aggression. Griffin's tweet, on the other hand, was widely seen as a comedic reaction to the controversy surrounding the Trump administration. While it may have been in poor taste, it did not have the same level of potential harm as Trump's tweets, which have been linked to increased violence and hate crimes.

Furthermore, the idea that Twitter should have a level of consistency in its moderation is a laudable goal, but it must be tempered with a nuanced understanding of online discourse. Twitter's platform is not a static entity, and its users are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is considered acceptable. A blanket ban on provocative speech would stifle free expression and create a culture of self-censorship. Instead, Twitter should focus on promoting transparency in its moderation policies, providing clear guidelines for users and ensuring that its moderators are held accountable for their decisions.

In the case of Griffin's tweet, it is possible that Twitter's moderators initially overreacted to the controversy surrounding her actions, and a more measured approach might have been more effective. However, this does not necessarily mean that she should have been banned outright. Rather, it highlights the need for Twitter to develop a more sophisticated approach to moderation, one that takes into account the complexities of online discourse and the diverse perspectives of its users. By doing so, Twitter can promote a more inclusive and respectful online environment without stifling free speech or creating a culture of outrage and censorship.","The argument that Kathy Griffin's tweets were an example of a double standard and should have led to her banning from Twitter ignores the complexities of the situation. Griffin's behavior, although ill-advised and hurtful, was a misguided attempt to make a statement about the dangers of unchecked free speech and censorship. By holding up a mock severed head of Donald Trump, Griffin aimed to spark a conversation about the limits of acceptable expression and the implications of censorship. This was not a call to violence, but rather a desperate cry of frustration from someone who felt her own free speech was being threatened.

Moreover, the intent behind Griffin's actions must be considered. In contrast to Steve Bannon's explicit calls for violence, Griffin's behavior was a thought-provoking, albeit crass, commentary on the state of free speech. Twitter's decision to flag her tweets and have her fired from her CNN show was a reasonable response to her actions, but it was not necessarily a case of a double standard. Instead, it was a reflection of the platform's desire to maintain a level of decorum and respect on its site.

Furthermore, the level of harm caused by Griffin's actions must be weighed against the actions of others who have been banned from Twitter. While Trump's tweets did indeed incite violence and promote hatred, Griffin's actions, although hurtful, did not rise to the same level of severity. Twitter's decision to ban Trump was a response to his consistent and egregious promotion of violence and hate speech, whereas Griffin's actions were a one-time mistake.

Ultimately, the complexities of social media moderation require a nuanced approach that takes into account the intent, level of harm, and context of each situation. Banning someone for a single, misguided tweet, while ignoring the consistent and egregious behavior of others, does little to promote free speech and instead creates a culture of censorship and fear. By considering the specific circumstances of each case, Twitter can maintain a fair and balanced approach to moderation, one that promotes free expression while also protecting users from harm.","While the desire for consistency in social media policies is laudable, it is essential to consider the context and nuances surrounding Kathy Griffin's situation. In contrast to Trump and Steve Bannon, who repeatedly used their platforms to spread misinformation and incite violence, Griffin's tweets were a one-time expression of outrage and frustration, albeit in a provocative manner. Holding a severed head in a photo, as Griffin did, is undeniably shocking and not comparable to Bannon's calls for beheadings or Trump's encouragement of violence against his opponents. However, Griffin's subsequent tweets, which suggested Trump should inject himself with hot air, were not necessarily a call to violence but rather a figurative expression of her disdain for the President's policies and actions.

Moreover, it is crucial to consider the differences between Griffin's and Bannon's or Trump's intentions. Griffin's tweets were an expression of her criticism of the Trump administration, whereas Bannon and Trump used their platforms to spread hate speech and incite violence. Twitter's decision to flag Griffin's tweets but not those of Bannon and Trump may have been influenced by the platform's desire to avoid amplifying conspiracy theories and hate speech, which has a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. In this sense, Twitter's actions can be seen as a strategic decision to mitigate the potential harm caused by certain types of content, rather than a double standard.

Furthermore, the context of Griffin's firing from CNN's New Year's show is also relevant. Griffin's behavior was deemed unacceptable by CNN, which suggests that she crossed a line that even some media outlets are unwilling to tolerate. This highlights the complexities of free speech and the need for nuanced discussions around what constitutes acceptable expression in different contexts. It is possible that Twitter, as a private company, made a judgment call about Griffin's tweets, taking into account the broader implications of her words and the potential for them to be interpreted as a call to violence.

Ultimately, while the author's concern for consistency in social media policies is valid, it is essential to approach this issue with a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding Griffin's situation. By considering the context, intentions, and potential impact of her tweets, it becomes clear that Twitter's decision was not necessarily a double standard, but rather a calculated move to mitigate harm and promote a safer online environment.","The comparison between Kathy Griffin's tweets and those of Trump or Steve Bannon is not entirely relevant. While Griffin's actions were certainly provocative, they did not directly incite violence or promote the dissemination of misinformation, which are the primary concerns when it comes to Twitter's moderation policies. In contrast, both Trump and Bannon have a long history of using their platforms to spread false information and encourage hostility towards specific groups. Furthermore, Griffin's tweets were never intended to be taken literally; they were meant as a satirical commentary on American politics and celebrity culture. The fact that some people took her joke seriously is not a reflection of the intent behind it. Twitter's decision to flag her tweets but not take further action can be seen as a reasonable response given the context, rather than evidence of a double standard. In any case, consistency in moderation policies is not always possible or desirable, especially when considering the nuances of free speech and satire.","The idea that Twitter should have banned Kathy Griffin for her tweets is predicated on an overly simplistic understanding of what constitutes ""incitement to violence."" While it's true that some people might interpret Griffin's actions as promoting harm towards Trump, this interpretation overlooks the complexities of language, context, and audience. Social media platforms are inherently ambiguous and subject to diverse interpretations; a single tweet can be understood in multiple ways by different individuals. Moreover, Twitter has a responsibility to balance its moderation policies with the protection of free speech, even when that means allowing for some degree of ambiguity and nuance. By banning Griffin or others who push the boundaries of what's acceptable on their platform, Twitter risks stifling important discussions and marginalizing voices that are essential to democratic discourse.","The notion that Kathy Griffin received a ""pass"" from Twitter due to her liberal politics is not supported by the facts. In reality, Griffin has faced significant backlash for her actions, including public ridicule, professional repercussions (such as being dropped from CNN's New Year's show), and a temporary suspension of her Twitter account. While this may not be equivalent to being banned outright, it still represents a consequence for pushing the boundaries of what's acceptable on social media. Furthermore, the expectation that Twitter should treat all users equally, regardless of their politics or ideology, is unrealistic given the platform's commercial goals and the need to maintain user engagement. By focusing on consistency in moderation policies, critics overlook the complexities of balancing competing interests and priorities in a rapidly evolving online environment."
t3_q3dmmn,"I'm not a fan of euthanasia More specifically I'm talking about voluntary euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. There is no way to be sure patient is committing assisted suicide of their own free will. With 'normal' suicide person's will manifests through physical actions that they take to kill themselves. If a patient is incapable of performing these physical steps there is no way to be certain they actually mean it. We've all said once in our lives that we want to end it but haven't actually done it. Same logic should apply to terminally ill patients. Even if they say they want to commit suicide, it doesn't mean they would actually do it if they were physically capable. So we shouldn't help them achieve it. In cases where a person is physically capable of committing suicide on their own we should never help them. I don't think it's controversial. But what if a person can only move one finger? They can push a button that delivers lethal overdose but can't do much else. I'd argue even in these cases physicians should not provide patients with means to overdose. Pressing a button is just too easy; it removes natural barriers that prevent us from hurting ourselves. For example, this theoretical patient would press the overdose button but would not hang themselves or otherwise actively kill themselves. Providing a patient with an easy way of killing themselves is intrinsically coercive and coercing people into committing suicide is generally considered bad. Disclaimer: There are many good arguments for and against euthanasia. I'm interested in issues with my specific argument about free will. I also don't care much about legal status of euthanasia.","The argument that helping a patient commit suicide undermines their autonomy because it makes the process too easy neglects the inherent value of relief from intractable suffering. Many patients who seek euthanasia have exhausted all other options and are faced with a future that they deem intolerable. In such cases, assisted suicide can be seen as an act of compassion rather than coercion. By providing patients with the means to end their lives, healthcare providers empower them to take control over their own destiny and make choices that align with their values and priorities. The button-pushing scenario you describe highlights the difficulties in navigating complex medical situations but does not justify withholding euthanasia altogether. In reality, many people who are unable to perform physical actions may still be capable of making informed decisions about their treatment, including assisted suicide. It is crucial to acknowledge that patients' capacity for decision-making cannot be reduced to a single dimension and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.","The assumption that patients who are unable to perform physical actions may not be genuinely seeking euthanasia overlooks the complexity of human experience. The decision to end one's life is often influenced by factors such as suffering, loss of autonomy, and the desire for dignity, which cannot be reduced to physical capability alone. In cases where a patient is physically incapable but mentally lucid, it is essential to prioritize their autonomy and self-determination. If a patient has made a clear and informed decision to end their life, then assisted suicide should be available as an option. The fact that some people may not follow through on suicidal thoughts does not negate the validity of those who do. Moreover, patients with severe physical limitations are often subject to immense emotional distress, which can exacerbate feelings of desperation. By withholding euthanasia from these individuals, healthcare providers may inadvertently perpetuate their suffering. Furthermore, assisted suicide laws typically include safeguards such as multiple assessments and evaluations by medical professionals to ensure that the patient's decision is genuine and informed.","The focus on the issue of free will in euthanasia discussions often overlooks the social and structural factors that contribute to a patient's desire to end their life. For instance, patients who are struggling with chronic pain or terminal illnesses may feel coerced by medical professionals into seeking euthanasia due to pressure from family members, insurance companies, or healthcare systems. Similarly, socioeconomic disparities can impact access to palliative care and other supportive services, leading patients to feel that they have no alternative but to pursue assisted suicide. By addressing these systemic issues, policymakers and healthcare providers can create an environment in which patients' choices are truly informed and autonomous. Furthermore, some countries with well-established euthanasia policies have implemented measures to safeguard against coercion, such as mandatory waiting periods or counseling services for patients considering assisted suicide. These examples demonstrate that it is possible to balance patient autonomy with safeguards against undue influence.","The notion that patients who are physically incapable of ending their lives without assistance cannot be trusted to make informed decisions about their own mortality is a paternalistic stance that undermines the fundamental principle of autonomy. It assumes that individuals who are unable to physically take their own lives are not capable of making rational decisions about their own well-being, which is a flawed assumption. In fact, patients who are terminally ill often experience a significant decline in physical abilities, but their cognitive capacity remains intact, allowing them to make informed decisions about their care. Furthermore, the idea that patients may change their minds about ending their lives if they were physically capable is a common misconception. Many people who are terminally ill and incapacitated still maintain their resolve to end their lives, and denying them the option of physician-assisted suicide would only serve to prolong their suffering and exacerbate their emotional distress.

The argument that physician-assisted suicide is coercive because it removes natural barriers to self-harm is also misplaced. While it is true that individuals who are physically capable of ending their lives without assistance may choose not to do so, this is not necessarily a result of the availability of physician-assisted suicide, but rather a reflection of the complexities of human decision-making. Moreover, the option of physician-assisted suicide is not a substitute for the natural barriers to self-harm, but rather a means of allowing patients to exercise their autonomy and dignity in the face of a terminal illness. By denying patients the option of physician-assisted suicide, we are not protecting them from themselves, but rather denying them the right to make their own decisions about their own lives.

The idea that a patient who can only move one finger should be denied the option of physician-assisted suicide because pressing a button is ""too easy"" is a narrow and unrealistic view of human decision-making. The physical act of ending one's life is not the only indicator of a person's resolve or autonomy. Many people who are terminally ill and incapacitated are able to make complex decisions about their care, and the option of physician-assisted suicide is not a substitute for their autonomy, but rather a means of allowing them to exercise it. By prioritizing caution and paternalism, we risk undermining the fundamental human right to autonomy and dignity, and perpetuating a system of oppression that denies vulnerable populations the ability to make their own decisions about their own lives.","Voluntary euthanasia is not about providing patients with an easy way to kill themselves, but rather about respecting their autonomy and agency in making life-or-death decisions. The notion that patients may not truly mean their words or that they would not follow through on their intentions if given the opportunity to act is a paternalistic assumption that undermines the very concept of autonomy. In democratic societies, citizens are granted the right to make choices that may seem unwise or ill-informed to others, as long as those choices do not harm others. Similarly, patients should be trusted to make decisions about their own lives, even if those decisions may seem difficult or unpalatable to others.

Moreover, the distinction between pressing a button and actively committing suicide is not as clear-cut as it seems. In fact, patients who are physically unable to perform the physical actions required for self-inflicted death may be more inclined to rely on the means provided by others, including physicians. By denying these patients access to lethal means, we may inadvertently prolong their suffering and limit their ability to exert control over their own lives. The focus on the ease of access to lethal means distracts from the primary concern of patient autonomy, which is the foundation of any democratic society.

Furthermore, the argument that providing patients with the means to end their lives is coercive is based on a flawed assumption that patients are inherently vulnerable and unable to make informed decisions. However, the reality is that patients who seek euthanasia often do so after careful consideration and consultation with medical professionals and loved ones. In fact, studies have shown that patients who have access to euthanasia options experience less anxiety and stress related to their impending death, as they are able to take control of their final days.

In contrast, denying patients access to voluntary euthanasia may lead to a range of negative consequences, including prolonged suffering, increased anxiety, and a sense of hopelessness. By limiting patients' choices and autonomy, we may inadvertently exacerbate their suffering and undermine their dignity in their final days. Ultimately, the decision to end one's life should be a personal choice, free from coercion and paternalism, and should be respected by healthcare providers and society as a whole.","While the concern for patients' free will is understandable, it is essential to recognize that terminally ill patients' autonomy and dignity are deeply intertwined with their ability to make end-of-life decisions. The notion that patients might say they want to end their lives but not actually follow through is a common misconception that fails to acknowledge the profound emotional and psychological burden these individuals often face. It is crucial to consider the patients' subjective experiences and the context in which they make these decisions, rather than relying solely on assumptions about human behavior. By providing patients with the means to end their suffering, healthcare providers can help them regain control over their lives and alleviate the distressing aspects of their condition.

Moreover, the casting director's understanding of human behavior and emotions would lead them to consider the possibility that patients may be exercising their free will in a way that is not immediately apparent. It is not the patient's ability to physically perform the act of self-destruction that determines their autonomy but rather their capacity to make informed decisions about their own lives. In cases where patients are unable to physically perform the act, physician-assisted suicide can be seen as a means to amplify their voice and uphold their right to self-determination. The focus should be on supporting patients' choices rather than second-guessing their motivations.

Furthermore, the original argument's emphasis on the ease of pressing a button as a factor in coercing patients into committing suicide neglects the complexity of human decision-making. Patients who are terminally ill often face immense physical and emotional pain, and the availability of a means to end their suffering can be a beacon of hope and relief. By providing patients with the option to end their lives on their own terms, healthcare providers can demonstrate respect for their autonomy and dignity, rather than imposing their own moral or philosophical values upon them. Ultimately, the casting director would argue that patients' self-determination and dignity should take precedence over concerns about free will, and that physician-assisted suicide can be a compassionate and humane response to the suffering of terminally ill individuals."
t3_87lj0c,"I don't want physics to advance any further. Firstly, I have a scientific background in genetics, so, 50 of me is totally against this statements, BUT
I see science of physics, especially quantum physics as a base for everything. And here I see the problem - if we figure out this utopian 'formula for everything', it does not make sense to investigate anything any further, because You can just holistically calculate anything - conditions in any possible planet, future path of every human, every event in the future. It just doesn't make sense to do something, because You can do anything and know what will happen even without doing it. Maybe this is impossible, but maybe major breakthrough that will allow it is just around the corner and now is the time to not let it happen, because it will kill curiosity.","The assumption that a complete understanding of quantum physics would render further investigation unnecessary is based on a flawed premise: that human curiosity and innovation are driven solely by the desire for utility. In reality, scientists are often motivated by a desire to understand the underlying mechanisms and laws governing the universe. This drive for knowledge can lead to unexpected applications and discoveries, as researchers explore new ideas and concepts. The history of science is replete with examples of investigators who pursued seemingly esoteric areas of study, only to find practical applications that transformed their fields. By continuing to push the boundaries of human understanding, scientists can uncover new relationships between phenomena, driving progress in various disciplines and fostering a deeper appreciation for the intricate workings of the universe.","The fear that a complete understanding of physics would eliminate the need for investigation overlooks the inherent value of scientific progress. By pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, scientists can uncover new concepts and theories that may have far-reaching implications, even if they are not immediately apparent. The discovery of quantum mechanics, for example, has led to advancements in fields as diverse as materials science, computing, and medicine, despite its initial focus on atomic physics. Moreover, the journey towards understanding is often more valuable than the destination itself; it fosters critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and collaboration among researchers. By continuing to explore the fundamentals of physics, scientists can develop new tools, methods, and perspectives that may lead to breakthroughs in areas not yet anticipated.","The notion that understanding the fundamental laws of physics would render further investigation unnecessary is a misconception based on an oversimplification of the complexity involved. In fact, even with a complete understanding of quantum physics, it would still be impossible to holistically calculate every possible outcome in every scenario. The number of potential interactions and variables involved in any given situation is virtually infinite, making such calculations impractical, if not entirely futile. Moreover, the pursuit of knowledge is driven by more than just utility; it is a fundamental aspect of human curiosity and drives progress in various fields. For instance, the understanding of genetics has led to numerous medical breakthroughs, yet this does not mean that further research in genetics is unnecessary. The beauty of scientific inquiry lies in its ability to uncover new and unexpected relationships between phenomena, driving innovation and growth.","The notion that a complete understanding of quantum physics would somehow diminish human curiosity and creativity is a misconception. Artistic expression is not solely driven by the need for knowledge, but by the human capacity for imagination and the desire to tell stories that capture the complexities and nuances of the human experience. In fact, some of the most compelling stories in film and television are those that explore the unknown, the unexplained, and the unknowable. Consider, for example, the enduring popularity of science fiction and horror genres, which often rely on the audience's fascination with the unknown to create a sense of tension and suspense.

Moreover, the idea that a ""formula for everything"" would render human curiosity obsolete is a flawed assumption. Human beings have an inherent drive to explore, to discover, and to push the boundaries of what is known. This drive is what has led to countless breakthroughs in science, art, and technology throughout history. It is not the destination of knowledge that matters, but the journey itself. The process of discovery, the thrill of the unknown, and the satisfaction of overcoming challenges are all essential components of the human experience.

Furthermore, the notion that a complete understanding of quantum physics would somehow stifle creativity is contradicted by the experiences of artists and writers who have drawn inspiration from the very principles of quantum mechanics. Consider, for example, the works of authors like Kurt Vonnegut and Douglas Adams, who used concepts from quantum physics to create thought-provoking and imaginative stories that explored the human condition. These examples demonstrate that the pursuit of knowledge can actually enrich and inspire artistic expression, rather than suppressing it.

In conclusion, the idea that a complete understanding of quantum physics would be detrimental to human curiosity and creativity is a misconception. The pursuit of knowledge is an inherent part of the human experience, and it is precisely this drive that has led to some of the most compelling stories and artistic expressions in history. Rather than viewing uncertainty and the unknown as obstacles, we should see them as opportunities for creative exploration and growth.","While it's understandable that the prospect of a complete understanding of quantum physics might seem daunting, it's essential to recognize that such a discovery wouldn't necessarily render scientific inquiry obsolete. In fact, the opposite is true  a deeper comprehension of the fundamental laws governing the universe would likely lead to an explosion of new questions and areas of investigation. For instance, understanding the intricacies of quantum gravity could reveal new avenues for studying the behavior of black holes, which are of paramount importance to astronomers like those working at the Event Horizon Telescope. Moreover, the potential applications of quantum physics in fields like cosmology and exoplanetary science would continue to drive innovation and discovery, as scientists seek to apply these principles to the study of distant celestial bodies and the origins of the universe.

The notion that a complete understanding of quantum physics would eliminate the need for curiosity-driven exploration is based on a misapprehension of the nature of scientific inquiry. Science is not merely about answering questions; it's also about asking new ones, often ones that arise from the very questions we thought we had answered. Furthermore, a complete understanding of quantum physics would likely reveal the complexities and limitations of our current knowledge, pointing to the need for further investigation and refinement. By embracing the pursuit of knowledge, scientists can continue to push the boundaries of what we thought was possible, fostering a culture of curiosity and exploration that would only be stifled by a premature halt to research.

In fact, some of the most profound discoveries in astronomy have arisen from the intersection of quantum physics and cosmology. The observation of gravitational waves, for instance, was made possible by our growing understanding of general relativity and the behavior of black holes. Similarly, the study of quantum entanglement has led to new insights into the nature of spacetime and the cosmos on the largest scales. Rather than viewing a complete understanding of quantum physics as a barrier to further discovery, we should see it as an opportunity to expand our knowledge of the universe and our place within it.","While the idea of a complete understanding of quantum physics may seem daunting, it is essential to recognize that such a breakthrough would not necessarily render curiosity meaningless. In fact, the opposite is true  a deeper understanding of the underlying laws governing the universe can foster a deeper appreciation and respect for the complexity of existence. By unraveling the mysteries of quantum physics, scientists can develop innovative solutions to some of humanity's most pressing challenges, such as cancer, where a holistic understanding of the underlying biology is crucial for developing effective treatments. For instance, recent advances in quantum physics have led to the development of new imaging techniques that have greatly improved our ability to visualize cancer progression and identify potential targets for therapy. Furthermore, a complete understanding of quantum physics could enable the development of novel cancer therapies that are tailored to the unique characteristics of individual tumors, leading to more effective and personalized treatments. Moreover, the pursuit of a complete understanding of quantum physics can also lead to breakthroughs in fields such as biotechnology, materials science, and medicine, which can have far-reaching benefits for human health and well-being. By embracing the challenges and opportunities presented by quantum physics, scientists can continue to push the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding, ultimately leading to a better world for all. It is essential to recognize that the pursuit of scientific knowledge is not a zero-sum game, where a gain in one area necessarily comes at the expense of another. Instead, scientific advancements often lead to a snowball effect, where each breakthrough builds upon previous discoveries, leading to an ever-increasing understanding of the world and its complexities. Ultimately, the pursuit of a complete understanding of quantum physics is not about rendering human existence meaningless, but about unlocking the secrets of the universe and harnessing its power to improve human life and alleviate suffering."
t3_178tnlv,"EVERYTHING is subjective Literally everything is subjective, or subject to interpretation. Please CMV by naming something that is objective. For example, some may think 112 is objective, but this is only true in Base 10 math. In Base 2 math, 1110, therefore making the first statement subjective. Another example, ""we've never stepped foot on Mars"" - who's we? How do you know, and can you prove it? (ik this sounds dumb) but what is proving this statement to be objective? A general consensus? Well that is sub-mf-jective. I understand that this creates a conundrum, and some may argue that me stating ""everything is subjective"" is an objective statement in and of itself. I don't disagree; I am very open to someone C'ing MV. Life's odd, and there's no definitive answer to anything. Is there?","The assertion that everything is subjective might hold some merit when applied to the realm of abstract ideas or philosophical concepts, but it appears to falter when confronted with the empirical evidence of the physical world. As a historian of medieval European settlements and architecture, it is possible to identify certain facts that are not subject to interpretation. For instance, the structural integrity of a well-preserved stone church in rural England can be measured and analyzed through various methods, including thermoluminescence dating and structural engineering assessments. The presence of Romanesque arches, Gothic windows, or fortified walls is not a matter of personal opinion but rather a verifiable aspect of the physical environment.

Furthermore, the historian's analysis of historical records can also be grounded in empirical evidence. Documents such as the Domesday Book or the Pipe Rolls provide a wealth of information about the layout, population, and economic activities of medieval English settlements. While these records may be subject to interpretation, the physical layout of the settlements themselves, as recorded in these documents, can be verified through archaeological excavations and site surveys. The excavated remains of medieval towns, such as York or Norwich, demonstrate a clear pattern of settlement growth and development that is not open to personal interpretation.

In addition, the physical properties of materials and building techniques used in medieval construction can also be objectively analyzed. For example, the use of specific types of mortar, the quality of stonework, or the design of architectural features can be studied and evaluated through scientific methods. This empirical approach allows historians to establish a common ground for understanding and discussing the physical aspects of medieval settlements and architecture, even if the interpretation of their historical significance may vary.

Ultimately, while it is true that human experiences and interpretations play a significant role in shaping our understanding of the past, the historian's focus on empirical evidence and physical evidence provides a foundation for objective truth that transcends personal perspectives. By embracing this approach, historians can establish a shared understanding of the material world that underlies human history, even if the abstract meanings and interpretations may continue to be subject to debate.","The author's assertion that everything is subjective may be an intriguing philosophical conundrum, but it neglects the power of shared human experiences and communal understanding. While it is true that individual perspectives can vary, certain aspects of human experience transcend subjective interpretation. For instance, the experience of suffering, loss, and joy are universally acknowledged and relatable across cultures and historical periods. The works of authors like Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre, who wrote extensively on the human condition, demonstrate that despite individual perspectives, human experiences can be shared and understood.

Furthermore, the example of 112 vs. 1110 in different mathematical bases oversimplifies the complexity of mathematical concepts. Math is not merely a matter of interpretation, but a system of rules and axioms that govern mathematical operations. The fact that different bases exist does not render math subjective, but rather highlights the versatility and adaptability of mathematical concepts. Similarly, the statement ""we've never stepped foot on Mars"" can be verified through empirical evidence and scientific inquiry, which provide a common ground for understanding and agreement.

The author's emphasis on the importance of context and interpretation is well-taken, but it does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that everything is subjective. Instead, it highlights the importance of nuance and complexity in understanding human experience. By acknowledging the role of language and interpretation, we can move beyond the simplistic dichotomy of subjectivity and objectivity, and towards a more nuanced understanding of reality. Ultimately, the human experience is not solely a product of individual perspectives, but a shared and communal endeavor that transcends subjective interpretation.","While it's true that individual perspectives can shape our understanding of the world, it's possible to identify certain aspects of reality that are not only universally agreed upon but also essential to human experience. For instance, the existence of a 24-hour clock, the concept of time zones, and the laws of physics are not up for debate. These objective facts form the backbone of our shared reality, allowing us to coordinate and communicate effectively. They are not subjective interpretations, but rather a foundation upon which we build our individual perspectives. Take, for example, the process of casting actors for a film. While personal taste may play a role in selecting the perfect actor for a role, the objective fact that an actor is, in fact, 5'10"" tall, or that they have a proven track record of delivering nuanced performances, are crucial in making informed casting decisions. Similarly, in the filmmaking process, the objective fact that a particular scene requires a sunrise at 6 am can be agreed upon by all parties involved. These objective facts may not be the most exciting or creative aspects of filmmaking, but they are essential for bringing a story to life in a way that resonates with audiences. By acknowledging and working with these objective realities, creative teams can avoid the pitfalls of subjective interpretations and create a more cohesive and engaging story. In the end, the importance of objective facts lies not in stifling creativity, but in providing a common language and shared understanding that enables effective collaboration and brings a project to fruition.","A critical examination reveals that some statements are more open to interpretation than others, but this doesn't imply that everything is subjective. Consider the notion of causality  if an object falls from a height, its descent can be attributed to gravity acting upon it. This isn't a matter of personal opinion or interpretation; it's a consequence of the laws governing physical interactions. Furthermore, while the term ""we've never stepped foot on Mars"" does involve a degree of uncertainty and reliance on collective knowledge, this doesn't undermine the objective fact that humans have not yet established a permanent presence on the Martian surface. In contrast to subjective claims, which often rely on ambiguous language or context-dependent understanding, statements about physical phenomena like gravity or planetary exploration can be grounded in empirical evidence and tested through experimentation.","The claim that everything is subjective downplays the significance of universal constants and fundamental principles governing the universe. Take quantum mechanics, for example  its predictions have been consistently confirmed by experiments across a wide range of scales and domains. The existence of these constant values and predictable patterns speaks to an underlying reality that transcends individual perceptions or perspectives. In addition, certain mathematical structures, such as group theory and geometry, exhibit inherent properties that are independent of human interpretation, demonstrating the presence of objective order in the universe. This order isn't solely a product of collective agreement but rather an expression of underlying principles that govern physical systems.","The notion that everything is subjective may seem convincing at first glance, but it overlooks the fact that certain aspects of reality are inherently tied to empirical observation and measurable data. The laws of physics, for instance, describe the behavior of physical systems in a mathematically precise manner, regardless of personal opinion or interpretation. While it's true that mathematical expressions can be represented differently across various bases, this doesn't negate the objective nature of the underlying physical phenomena they describe. In fact, the ability to consistently predict and measure outcomes using these laws speaks to their objectivity. Moreover, scientific findings are typically verified through replication and experimentation, which helps to establish a consensus among researchers that transcends individual perspectives. This shared understanding isn't based on a ""general consensus"" but rather on the collective results of careful observation and experimentation. The existence of objective truth in science doesn't preclude the possibility for multiple interpretations or nuances within a particular framework; it simply acknowledges the presence of verifiable, empirical evidence."
t3_9syrun,"I would be a hypocrite to vote for Keith Ellison as Attorney General. I live in Minnesota. Im a liberal and believe very strongly in social progressiveness and especially in undoing literally all socially conservative policies. So I am truly in a conundrum here about how I ought to vote in the Attorney General race in Minnesota. The Republican candidate, Doug Wardlow, would be very happy to create laws against gays and against women which I find abhorrent. But on the other hand, youve got Keith Ellison and the accusations against him by his ex-girlfriend as clear evidence that he is yet another man using the power of his gender against the weak, for whatever benefit he thinks is best. More importantly, since the start of the Me Too movement, I have made a point of saying that despicable people need to have their power stripped from them, no matter what policies they support. The government is still led by people, and those people need to be our very best. Being abusive to your girlfriend is more than enough for me to write off a person as a scumbag. I was also 100 in favor of Al Frankens fall and was from the start. I have to stand by my principles. That being said, the Republican candidate would do actual damage to millions of people in my state if he actually got his way, promoting policies against gays and against reproductive rights, especially birth control which is just common sense at this point. Its far worse for my state if Doug Wardlow won. But still...how do you vote for a guy that abuses his girlfriend?","The argument that Keith Ellison is unfit for office due to allegations of misconduct from his ex-girlfriend relies on an overly simplistic and binary understanding of personal behavior and moral leadership. It ignores the complexities of power dynamics in relationships and fails to account for the possibility that individuals can learn and grow from their experiences. In evaluating a candidate's fitness for public office, it is more productive to focus on their policy positions, track record, and commitment to serving all citizens rather than perpetuating a flawed narrative about personal character. Additionally, the critique of Ellison ignores the fact that many people, including some well-respected leaders, have faced similar allegations without suffering lasting consequences.","The concern about Keith Ellison's past behavior is understandable, but it should not overshadow the immense progress he has made in his personal and professional life. Consider the numerous leaders who have been held to an impossibly high standard of moral perfection. In reality, many individuals are capable of growth and change after being confronted with their flaws. The fact that Ellison has acknowledged his past mistakes and is now advocating for women's rights and social justice should be weighed against his opponent's clear intent to dismantle reproductive freedom. The stakes in this election are too high to allow a nuanced discussion about character to overshadow the pressing policy issues at hand. Ultimately, the decision comes down to which candidate will better serve Minnesota's marginalized communities.","The emphasis on Keith Ellison's past behavior as a barrier to his candidacy overlooks the long history of marginalized communities being forced to choose between imperfect leaders and those who actively seek to harm them. It also ignores the broader societal context in which individuals are held accountable for their actions. In many cases, the consequences for men accused of misconduct pale in comparison to the real-world impacts of policies like those advocated by Doug Wardlow. The decision to vote for Ellison is not a moral compromise but rather a pragmatic choice about who will better serve Minnesota's most vulnerable populations. By choosing Ellison, voters are effectively saying that they prioritize policy and politics over personal opinions about individual character.","In evaluating the moral character of public figures, it's essential to consider the context of their actions, not just their personal lives. While Keith Ellison's past behavior has undoubtedly raised concerns, it's crucial to examine the severity and relevance of these allegations in relation to his professional record and the issues he aims to address as Attorney General. In contrast, Doug Wardlow's platform prioritizes policies that would actively harm marginalized communities, including women's reproductive rights, LGBTQ individuals, and other vulnerable groups. By focusing solely on Keith Ellison's personal conduct, one might overlook the far-reaching implications of electing a politician who would actively work to undermine the progress made by these communities.

Furthermore, considering the casting director's own stance on Al Franken's resignation, it's clear that they value holding public figures accountable for their actions. However, in this case, Keith Ellison's misconduct, although unacceptable, should not be the sole determining factor in his candidacy. The severity of Doug Wardlow's potential harm to the people of Minnesota far outweighs any personal flaws of Keith Ellison, making it a question of choosing the lesser of two evils. In the context of politics, where compromise and nuance are often necessary, it's essential to prioritize the greater good and the potential consequences of each candidate's policies.

It's also worth noting that politicians, like actors, are complex individuals with multiple facets to their character. Keith Ellison's mistakes do not define his entire persona, and his dedication to social justice and progressiveness are undeniable. In contrast, Doug Wardlow's ideology is deeply concerning, and his election would undoubtedly lead to significant harm for many Minnesotans. By evaluating the candidates based on their policies and professional conduct, rather than their personal lives, it's possible to make a more informed decision that aligns with the author's values and prioritizes the well-being of the community. Ultimately, the casting director persona would argue that, in this case, the greater good and the potential harm caused by Doug Wardlow's policies should take precedence over Keith Ellison's personal flaws.","In examining the complexities of human nature, particularly within the context of medieval European settlements, it becomes apparent that individuals with power often walked a fine line between virtuous leadership and flawed character. The lord or lordess of a medieval manor, for instance, held significant authority over their subjects, yet their personal lives and relationships were often marked by intrigue and moral ambiguity. The same dynamics of power and influence exist in contemporary politics, where leaders, like Keith Ellison, wield significant authority and must navigate complex relationships within and outside their professional sphere. It is essential to consider the multifaceted nature of character, rather than reducing a person's entire identity to a single incident or accusation.

The Me Too movement has undoubtedly brought to light the pervasive issue of power imbalance and abuse, and it is crucial to hold individuals in positions of power accountable for their actions. However, in doing so, we must also recognize that individuals are capable of growth, redemption, and change. Keith Ellison's past behavior, while undoubtedly troubling, does not define his entire character or disqualify him from public service. In fact, his willingness to confront his past mistakes and engage in self-reflection demonstrates a level of accountability and personal growth that is essential for effective leadership.

Furthermore, the author's emphasis on Keith Ellison's past actions overlooks the significant benefits he would bring to the role of Attorney General. His commitment to social progressiveness and advocacy for marginalized communities would undoubtedly lead to positive change and protection for millions of Minnesotans. In contrast, Doug Wardlow's candidacy poses a significant threat to the rights and well-being of many, particularly the LGBTQ community and women. The potential harm caused by Wardlow's policies would far outweigh any concerns about Keith Ellison's character, making him a more palatable choice for those who prioritize the greater good.

Ultimately, the historian's approach to evaluating character suggests that we should not expect perfection from our leaders but rather a nuanced understanding of their complexities and a willingness to grow and learn. By acknowledging the imperfections of human nature, we can make more informed decisions about the candidates who will best serve the people of Minnesota.","While it is understandable that Keith Ellison's past behavior has led some to question his character, it is essential to recognize that his policies align closely with the values of the liberal Democrat. Keith Ellison has been a champion of social progressiveness, working tirelessly to advance the rights of marginalized communities and fight against socially conservative policies. In contrast, Doug Wardlow's policies would inflict significant harm on the very people that the liberal Democrat seeks to protect. The potential consequences of a Wardlow victory, including the erosion of reproductive rights, the promotion of discriminatory policies against the LGBTQ community, and the undermining of birth control access, would be devastating for Minnesota. Furthermore, it is worth noting that Keith Ellison has taken steps to address his past mistakes and has demonstrated a commitment to personal growth and accountability.

Moreover, the liberal Democrat should consider that holding public figures to an impossibly high standard of personal character can lead to a form of moral absolutism that may not be practical or effective in the real world. In the context of electoral politics, voters often must choose between imperfect candidates who share their values and those who do not. In this case, the choice is not between a perfect candidate and an imperfect one, but between a candidate who aligns with the liberal Democrat's values and one who would actively work to harm the communities they care about.

It is also worth considering the potential long-term consequences of holding a candidate like Keith Ellison accountable for past mistakes while allowing a candidate like Doug Wardlow to win. Would this outcome truly advance the cause of social progressiveness, or would it simply enable a candidate who would work to undermine the very principles the liberal Democrat holds dear? By voting for Keith Ellison, the liberal Democrat can help to ensure that the state continues to move forward on issues like reproductive rights, LGBTQ equality, and social justice, even if Keith Ellison's past behavior is not without blemish. Ultimately, the liberal Democrat must consider the broader implications of their vote and choose the candidate who best aligns with their values and priorities."
t3_acw4be,"Claiming that 'men are trash' is counter productive to gender equality I am not saying in general men don't commit more crimes. I just think lumping all men together like this is unnecessarily negative and actually holds society back. If you want, read this argument I just had and ignore the terrible grammar: 
What do you think we should reconsider about our views? All I want is to compromise here but not if it means believing in hate speach spread by word of mouth. Does anyone know of any good unbiased articles regarding this matter? Any well thought out opinions would be also helpful. Edit: I have updated some of my comments to give deltas and fully reflect what I know believe. I in no way completely altered what claim I was originally making. It was difficult for me to patronize a seemingly overly negative stance when unbiased points about the matter were not also brought to my attention. This does not mean I do not feel the desire to correct some of the bias opinions I held as well, or may still hold. Making this post has allowed me to better structure my beliefs on the matter in a way that more appropriately sympathizes for woman who still have to fight for equality in many ways. I am very grateful we share the right to express ourselves aggressively as we see fit, yet I will not fully support phrases which insult others for the sake of bringing attention to the matter. It is not an entirely counter productive way of creating change but I still see it as a flawed method which can easily divide people when the true goal is the opposite.","Critics of the argument that 'men are trash' may argue that it is counterproductive to gender equality, but they overlook the fact that this phrase is not a dismissive statement, but rather a critical reflection of the disproportionate representation of men in positions of power and the perpetuation of patriarchal systems that maintain and exacerbate these inequalities. The statement is not a call for hatred, but rather an acknowledgment of the historical and systemic injustices that have been perpetrated against women and other marginalized groups. By acknowledging and naming these injustices, we can begin to work towards dismantling the power structures that perpetuate them, rather than perpetuating the status quo through silence or overly simplistic solutions. In fact, research has shown that framing issues in a critical and nuanced manner, rather than avoiding controversy or offending certain groups, can actually increase public engagement and mobilization on issues related to social justice.

Moreover, the notion that this phrase is ""hate speech"" or overly negative is a mischaracterization that ignores the historical context of feminist theory and activism. The phrase 'men are trash' is a reclamation of language, a way of taking back the narrative and reframing it to reflect the reality of the experiences of women and other marginalized groups. It is not meant to be a personal attack, but rather a call to action, a way of highlighting the need for change and the need for men to recognize and challenge their own complicity in perpetuating patriarchal systems. In fact, this type of language can be a powerful tool for mobilizing men to become allies and advocates for feminist causes, rather than simply bystanders or perpetrators.

Furthermore, the argument that this phrase is counterproductive to gender equality ignores the fact that men's rights and feminist movements are not mutually exclusive. In fact, research has shown that men's rights activism and feminist activism can be mutually beneficial, and that men's rights activism can actually increase support for feminist causes and policies. By acknowledging and addressing the systemic inequalities and biases that affect men and women, we can create a more just and equitable society for all. The goal of feminist activism is not to demonize men, but to create a world where everyone has equal rights and opportunities, regardless of their gender. By recognizing the value of nuanced and critical language, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society, rather than simply avoiding controversy or offending certain groups.","The argument that labeling men as ""trash"" is counterproductive to achieving gender equality fails to account for the historical context in which patriarchal systems have been built. The notion that men are inherently trash oversimplifies the complex power structures that have been imposed upon women throughout history. In medieval England, for instance, men held positions of power and privilege, often using this to marginalize and oppress women. However, this was not solely a male issue, but rather a product of societal norms and institutions that perpetuated inequality.

While it is true that men have historically been the primary perpetrators of oppression, it is also true that women have been complicit in these systems, and that many men have worked towards creating change. The historian's experience with rural England's social dynamics reveals that even in the most seemingly insular communities, there were men who challenged the status quo and fought for women's rights. By acknowledging the complexity of these historical dynamics, we can begin to understand that the issue is not simply about men versus women, but about a broader system of power and privilege that requires a multifaceted approach to dismantle.

Labeling men as ""trash"" may be seen as a form of catharsis, but it risks alienating those who may be open to change and instead reinforcing the very same patriarchal structures that we seek to dismantle. This is not to say that the term is inherently counterproductive, but rather that it is a narrow and simplistic approach to a complex issue. By embracing a more nuanced understanding of the historical context, we can create a more inclusive and effective language that speaks to the experiences of all marginalized groups, rather than relying on binary oppositions that only serve to further entrench inequality. Ultimately, the goal of achieving gender equality requires a deep understanding of the complex power dynamics at play, and a willingness to engage in nuanced and multifaceted discussions that challenge our assumptions and broaden our perspectives.","The assertion that labeling men as ""trash"" is counterproductive to gender equality may be well-intentioned, but it fails to recognize the historical and systemic context in which patriarchy has been perpetuated. This broad characterization can be seen as a form of silencing and further marginalization, rather than a catalyst for change. It's essential to acknowledge that men are not a monolithic group, and many men are actively working to dismantle the very systems of oppression that have been imposed upon women. By dismissing all men as ""trash,"" we risk silencing the voices of those who are willing to listen, learn, and grow.

Moreover, this kind of rhetoric can be alienating to men who are genuinely committed to feminism and equality, causing them to feel excluded and disempowered. This can ultimately undermine the progress made towards achieving true equality, as men who are not part of the ""problem"" may feel reluctant to engage in the conversation. It's crucial to recognize that men are not inherently inferior or inherently oppressive; rather, they are socialized and conditioned to participate in systems of power that perpetuate inequality. By framing the issue in this way, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and constructive dialogue that acknowledges the agency and humanity of all individuals, regardless of their gender.

In the context of the entertainment industry, where the casting director operates, this kind of nuanced approach is particularly essential. By fostering a culture of empathy and understanding, we can create more inclusive and representative storytelling that accurately reflects the complexities of the human experience. This, in turn, can help to break down stereotypes and challenge the dominant narratives that perpetuate inequality. By working together, men and women can co-create a more just and equitable society, where everyone has an equal opportunity to thrive.","The argument that ""men are trash"" is counterproductive to gender equality relies on an overly optimistic view of human nature, which assumes that individuals can simply ""choose"" not to be sexist or misogynistic. However, research has consistently shown that implicit biases and social conditioning play a significant role in shaping attitudes toward women. By ignoring these structural factors, the original argument inadvertently reinforces a victim-blaming narrative: if men are somehow able to overcome their ingrained biases, then the onus is on them to ""choose"" not to harm women.

Furthermore, this argument underestimates the impact of systemic sexism and its far-reaching consequences for women. From education to employment, healthcare to media representation, women face persistent barriers that cannot be addressed solely through individual moral rectitude. The phrase ""men are trash"" may seem crass, but it serves as a stark reminder of these inequalities and highlights the need for a more fundamental transformation in societal attitudes.

A more effective approach would involve acknowledging the intersectional nature of sexism and working to dismantle entrenched systems that perpetuate harm against women. This requires a nuanced understanding of how power operates and a willingness to confront uncomfortable truths about our collective complicity in maintaining these systems.","The claim that ""men are trash"" is unnecessary negative and holds society back relies on an unrealistic expectation that language alone can shape people's attitudes and behaviors. However, language has long been recognized as a crucial tool for social change, capable of reframing public discourse, challenging dominant narratives, and mobilizing collective action. The Civil Rights Movement, the LGBTQ rights movement, and feminist activism have all leveraged provocative rhetoric to galvanize support and push for systemic reform.

Moreover, the argument assumes that promoting equality requires an overly narrow focus on avoiding offense rather than confronting the pervasive nature of sexism in our society. By downplaying or dismissing language that challenges these systems, we risk allowing them to persist unchecked. Women, non-binary individuals, and marginalized communities have been using provocative rhetoric to push back against systemic injustices for centuries; it's time to recognize the value of this approach rather than dismissing it as ""hate speech.""

Ultimately, rather than reducing a complex discussion on gender equality to simplistic binary choices (i.e., being positive vs. being negative), we should strive for a more nuanced understanding that acknowledges both the importance of challenging systemic injustices and the need to engage with multiple perspectives in order to build coalitions and foster meaningful change.","The notion that ""men are trash"" is a simplistic and inaccurate representation of the complexities involved in achieving gender equality. By dismissing this phrase as ""hate speech,"" the argument overlooks the power dynamics that enable men to perpetuate harm against women. Critiquing patriarchal systems and challenging individual behavior can be done without resorting to blanket statements, but it's essential to acknowledge that some men are complicit in maintaining these systems. It's also crucial to recognize that women and non-binary individuals often face unique barriers that require targeted solutions, not a one-size-fits-all approach.

Moreover, the argument assumes that promoting equality requires avoiding ""negative"" language, which is an overly narrow definition of effective social commentary. Many marginalized groups have successfully used provocative rhetoric to highlight systemic injustices. The Women's March, for instance, employed powerful imagery and language to raise awareness about women's rights issues. It's essential to engage with the complexities of power structures rather than seeking a watered-down approach that prioritizes avoiding offense over challenging systems of oppression.

Ultimately, reducing a nuanced discussion on gender equality to a simplistic binary (i.e., ""men are trash"" vs. being neutral) neglects the rich insights and experiences of women who continue to face substantial barriers in achieving parity. Rather than dismissing uncomfortable truths as ""hate speech,"" it's crucial to engage with these complexities and develop a more comprehensive understanding of how patriarchal systems operate."
t3_678y49,"We are not living in a simulation. Elon Musk says that it is most likely that we are living in a simulation. His only way to support it is a philosophical paper written 15 years ago. The paper is all about probability, and it evaluates how out of all possible scenarios for mankind, the most likely is that we end up creating a simulation, and therefore we are most likely in a simulation. There are many problems I find with this:
-Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. - Carl Sagan.There is ( to my knowledge ) no scientific evidence to support the claim that we are living in a simulation, something needed in order to make the claim at least slightly believable. -Using probability to reach the conclusion is not enough. Statistically, It is more probable that I, the person that created this post, is chinese (because of the amount of people from a certain country in the world), and yet you do not take it as a fact that I am, nor you take it as a fact that every internet stranger must be chinese. 
-What's the point of being so skeptical about our reality? I see no benefit to questioning our reality to this extent, in which we cannot completely prove, only speculate.  the CMV moderators.","The assumption that probability is insufficient evidence for a philosophical claim overlooks the fact that Musk's paper is not intended to provide empirical proof, but rather an exploration of the possibility. The appeal to extraordinary claims requires extraordinary evidence is a valid concern; however, it is also important to consider the burden of skepticism when evaluating such a notion. In this case, the onus lies with those who claim we are living in a simulated reality to provide adequate justification for their stance. Furthermore, using probability as a tool for reasoning about large-scale scenarios is not inherently flawed, especially when considering the vast complexities involved.","The comparison between probability and statistical likelihood is apt, but it misses the point that these different scenarios operate under distinct epistemological frameworks. The analogy with internet users being Chinese only serves to highlight the problem of over-reliance on statistical trends as a means of proving reality. It is precisely this lack of concrete evidence that renders the simulated reality hypothesis suspect, especially when considering the implications for our understanding of physics and mathematics. Musk's paper relies on assumptions about human behavior and technological advancements that are uncertain at best.","The skepticism directed toward questioning the nature of reality oversimplifies the motivations behind investigating such a topic. The notion that there is no benefit in speculating about simulated reality neglects the potential value of exploring this idea as a thought experiment, rather than a definitive assertion. By examining the possibility of simulated existence, philosophers and scientists may uncover novel insights into the human condition, cognition, and the limits of knowledge. Moreover, the discussion surrounding simulated reality has sparked debates that transcend philosophy and enter the realm of science fiction, literature, and art, inspiring new perspectives on the human experience.","It is understandable that the author remains skeptical about the simulation hypothesis, given the lack of concrete evidence to support it. However, the absence of empirical proof does not necessarily render an idea unfalsifiable or unworthy of consideration. In fact, some of the most groundbreaking scientific discoveries in history were initially met with skepticism and dismissed as fanciful ideas. The notion of dark matter, for instance, was once considered a fringe theory, yet it has since been extensively studied and is now widely accepted as a fundamental component of the universe. Similarly, the concept of black holes was first proposed as a theoretical possibility, but it has since been extensively observed and confirmed through a variety of astrophysical phenomena. The simulation hypothesis, though unproven, deserves a similar level of consideration and exploration, as it challenges our current understanding of reality and encourages us to think creatively about the nature of existence. Furthermore, the argument that probability alone is not enough to support the simulation hypothesis is a valid point, but it is essential to consider the context in which this probability is being applied. If we assume that advanced civilizations have the capability to create sophisticated simulations, then it is indeed plausible that we are living in a simulated reality. The point about the author's nationality being more probable statistically is a clever analogy, but it does not directly address the question at hand. In the context of the simulation hypothesis, we are not discussing the likelihood of an individual's nationality, but rather the possibility of a collective, advanced civilization creating a simulated reality. Ultimately, the value of exploring the simulation hypothesis lies not in its potential to provide definitive answers but in its ability to inspire new areas of research and encourage a deeper understanding of the universe and our place within it. By embracing this idea, we may uncover new avenues of inquiry and make significant strides in our understanding of the cosmos.","The original argument relies heavily on a philosophical paper that, although influential, falls short of providing concrete evidence for the simulation hypothesis. While it is true that probability can be used to estimate the likelihood of certain outcomes, it is a statistical tool, not a substitute for empirical evidence. The example of the statistical probability of the author being Chinese is apt, as it illustrates that probability alone does not determine reality. The fact that we do not take it as a fact that every internet stranger is Chinese highlights the importance of considering additional evidence and context. In the field of oncology, we rely on rigorous clinical trials and evidence-based medicine to inform our treatment decisions, and we would not accept probability as a substitute for empirical evidence in determining the efficacy of a new therapy. Similarly, the nature of reality is too fundamental to be based on statistical probability alone. Furthermore, the simulation hypothesis has significant implications for our understanding of the human condition and the nature of consciousness, and it is essential to approach it with a critical and evidence-based mindset. Without a clear method to test or disprove the simulation hypothesis, we risk entering a realm of speculation and unfalsifiable claims. The lack of empirical evidence for the simulation hypothesis raises more questions than it answers, and it is essential to approach it with a healthy dose of skepticism. While it is true that questioning our reality can lead to new insights and perspectives, it is equally important to ground those questions in empirical evidence and rigorous testing. In the end, the burden of proof lies with those making the extraordinary claim, and until we have more robust evidence, the simulation hypothesis remains a topic of speculation rather than a scientific fact.","While it's understandable that the lack of concrete evidence supporting the simulation hypothesis may lead some to dismiss it as unfounded, the absence of direct proof should not necessarily negate the possibility. After all, many groundbreaking scientific theories and discoveries were once met with skepticism, only to be later vindicated by empirical evidence. The fact that Elon Musk's argument is based on a philosophical paper 15 years ago does not necessarily invalidate its underlying logic. In fact, it highlights the pioneering nature of the idea, which challenges our conventional understanding of reality and encourages further investigation.

Moreover, Musk's use of probability as a means to evaluate the likelihood of our existence within a simulated reality is not entirely without merit. While it may not be a definitive proof, it is a thought-provoking exercise that prompts us to consider the vastness of human potential and our capacity for innovation. Just as a skilled director would consider multiple storylines and character arcs when crafting a narrative, it's possible that our reality could be a complex, multifaceted construct designed to serve a specific purpose or tell a particular story. The idea that probability alone cannot establish the truth of the simulation hypothesis is a valid point, but it should not be used to dismiss the idea outright.

Furthermore, the analogy with the probability of the author being Chinese is a clever one, but it doesn't entirely apply to the simulation hypothesis. In the case of the author's nationality, there is a tangible, measurable aspect (the number of people from a certain country), whereas the simulation hypothesis deals with the fundamental nature of reality, which is inherently abstract and difficult to quantify. The benefits of exploring the simulation hypothesis extend beyond the realm of scientific inquiry, as it has the potential to inspire new artistic and philosophical perspectives on our existence. By considering the idea, we may uncover novel insights into the human condition, the role of technology in shaping our lives, and the possibilities of what it means to be alive."
t3_bwhb0p,"Carbon Dioxide emissions from transportation vehicles will not decrease until gasoline prices rise significantly Right now, gas is still cheap enough that many car owners in North America do not have a financial incentive to buy electric vehicles, or take public transport more often. People with a small budget would opt to buy second-hand cars, and currently the market for second hand electric vehicles are almost non-existent. As for increasing tax cuts on electric vehicle purchases, the easiest way for the government to fund that would be to increase the carbon tax, which would lead to higher gas prices. Of course, eventually public transportation may become more convenient, or electric vehicles become cheaper, but for now EVs remain a very niche, and somewhat expensive product, while I've seen no trends which indicate a significant improvement of public transportation is underway. It appears to me that you can't have low gas prices and reduce CO2 emissions at the same time.","The argument that low gas prices are necessary for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from transportation vehicles fails to account for the broader implications of relying solely on price mechanisms to drive behavior change. Higher gas prices would disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including low-income households and those with limited access to public transportation or alternative modes of transport. Moreover, by focusing primarily on price, policymakers may overlook other effective strategies for reducing emissions, such as investing in green infrastructure, promoting sustainable land use planning, and encouraging non-motorized transportation options like cycling and walking. A more nuanced approach would consider the social and economic implications of policy decisions, ensuring that the transition to cleaner modes of transport is equitable and inclusive for all members of society. By taking a more holistic view, policymakers can develop effective solutions that balance environmental goals with social and economic imperatives.","The assumption that a significant increase in gasoline prices is necessary for a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions from transportation vehicles overlooks the potential impact of government policies on consumer behavior. A comprehensive approach, including subsidies for low-income households to purchase electric vehicles, could incentivize more people to switch to cleaner modes of transport without relying solely on higher gas prices. Moreover, investing in public transportation infrastructure and making it more accessible can also reduce emissions by providing a reliable alternative to personal vehicle ownership. In many European countries, the cost of gasoline has been high for years, yet electric vehicles have become increasingly popular, suggesting that other factors such as convenience, range anxiety, and charging infrastructure play a significant role in adoption rates. Furthermore, cities with well-developed public transportation systems often see lower levels of air pollution, even without significant increases in gas prices. By addressing these underlying issues, policymakers can encourage the transition to cleaner modes of transport without relying solely on price mechanisms.","The notion that electric vehicles are a niche product and remain too expensive for widespread adoption is an oversimplification of market trends and technological advancements. While it is true that EVs have historically been more expensive than their gasoline-powered counterparts, the cost gap has been narrowing rapidly over the past decade. In addition, many car manufacturers are shifting production towards more affordable models, driven by increasing demand and economies of scale. The example of Norway, where electric vehicles make up a significant portion of new car sales, demonstrates that high upfront costs can be mitigated through government incentives, lower operating expenses, and favorable tax policies. Moreover, as charging infrastructure expands, concerns about range anxiety will continue to decrease, making EVs more appealing to a broader audience. By acknowledging these developments, policymakers can create an environment conducive to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.","The assertion that low gas prices and reduced CO2 emissions are mutually exclusive is a shortsighted view that neglects the far-reaching consequences of climate change on ecosystems. The entomological record is replete with examples of species' adaptations to changing environmental conditions, but it also highlights the devastating impacts of climate-induced disruptions. The decline of pollinator populations, such as monarch butterflies and hummingbird hawk moths, is a stark reminder of the delicate balance that exists within ecosystems. By prioritizing fossil fuel consumption, we risk compromising the very fabric of these ecosystems, with cascading effects that could have disastrous consequences for biodiversity and human well-being.

Furthermore, the argument that electric vehicles are a niche product is based on a flawed assumption that technological innovation is stagnant. The automotive industry has made tremendous strides in recent years, with electric vehicles becoming increasingly affordable and accessible. In fact, many countries have implemented policies to incentivize the adoption of electric vehicles, such as tax credits and investment in charging infrastructure. These efforts have led to a significant increase in electric vehicle sales, demonstrating that with the right policy framework, the market can drive change.

Moreover, the notion that public transportation is not improving overlooks the many initiatives underway to enhance public transportation systems, such as expanded bus networks and bike-share programs. In cities like Bogotá, Colombia, and Medellín, Colombia, public transportation has been transformed to prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety, reducing congestion and emissions. By investing in sustainable transportation options, we can create healthier, more livable cities that benefit both people and the environment.

In conclusion, the relationship between gas prices and CO2 emissions is not a zero-sum game, where one must be sacrificed for the other. Rather, it is a false dichotomy that neglects the long-term consequences of our actions. By working together, we can create a more sustainable future that balances economic and environmental considerations, ensuring a healthier planet for all species, including the ones the entomologist dedicates their life to studying.","The assumption that low gas prices are necessary to maintain a thriving market is flawed, as it neglects the long-term benefits of investing in alternative fuel sources and sustainable transportation systems. In fact, several countries have successfully implemented policies to incentivize the adoption of electric vehicles without significantly increasing gas prices. For instance, Norway offers significant tax exemptions and subsidies for EV owners, which has led to a remarkable 50 market share of electric vehicles. Meanwhile, the government collects revenue from carbon emissions through a carbon tax, which funds investments in public transportation and green infrastructure. This approach not only reduces emissions but also promotes economic growth by creating new job opportunities and industries in the renewable energy sector. Furthermore, increasing gas prices would disproportionately affect low-income households, who may not have the means to invest in more expensive electric vehicles. In contrast, governments can design targeted incentives that benefit low-income households, such as low-interest loans or direct financial assistance for EV purchases. Moreover, the notion that the market for second-hand electric vehicles is nonexistent is inaccurate; many countries are seeing a rise in EV adoption, and second-hand marketplaces are emerging to cater to this growing demand. Public transportation infrastructure can also be improved incrementally, with governments investing in bus electrification, bike-share programs, and pedestrian-friendly city planning. By promoting a multi-faceted approach that includes government incentives, private sector innovation, and community engagement, countries can successfully transition to a low-carbon transportation system without harming the economy or consumers. In fact, a study by the International Energy Agency found that a well-designed low-carbon transportation system can create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and reduce emissions while maintaining consumer affordability. By adopting a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between market forces, government policies, and societal needs, policymakers can create a more sustainable and equitable transportation system for all.","While the notion that low gas prices are a barrier to reducing CO2 emissions from transportation vehicles may hold some truth, it is an oversimplification of the complex interplay between market forces and consumer behavior. In reality, people's purchasing decisions are influenced by a multitude of factors beyond just price, including convenience, lifestyle, and personal values. For instance, studies have shown that consumers are willing to pay a premium for sustainable products, including electric vehicles, when they perceive them as aligning with their personal values. Moreover, the growing demand for EVs is driving economies of scale, which in turn is making them more affordable for the average consumer.

Furthermore, the author's assumption that the market for second-hand electric vehicles is non-existent is inaccurate. In fact, many used EVs are being sold, often at a lower price than their gas-powered counterparts, and can be found in various online marketplaces and local listings. This suggests that the used EV market is not as stagnant as claimed, and that consumers are indeed starting to consider electric vehicles as a viable option. Additionally, public transportation may not be as stagnant as the author suggests; cities are investing heavily in modernizing their public transit systems, and ride-sharing services like bike-sharing and car-sharing are becoming increasingly popular.

The author's emphasis on the need for a carbon tax to fund EV incentives overlooks the potential for private sector innovation and investment. Companies are already exploring alternative funding models, such as vehicle-as-a-service plans, which can make EVs more accessible to a wider range of consumers. Moreover, governments can explore partnerships with private sector companies to provide financing options for EV purchases, rather than solely relying on carbon taxes. This approach can help reduce the upfront costs associated with EV adoption and make them more appealing to consumers.

Moreover, the author's argument that low gas prices and reduced CO2 emissions are mutually exclusive is an exaggeration. In reality, many countries have successfully reduced emissions while maintaining low gas prices through a combination of market-based incentives and government regulations. For instance, Norway has implemented a range of policies, including tax exemptions and subsidies, to encourage EV adoption, resulting in a significant reduction in emissions while maintaining low gas prices. This example demonstrates that it is possible to balance economic and environmental goals without sacrificing one for the other."
t3_7e3m1l,"I think people who have children while on welfare should lose all benefits. Seriously, I can't support this current system of welfare. The more children you have, the more money you get from the government. Screw that, if you can't support yourself you shouldn't be having children, especially if you make me pay for it. NOTE: I am not against welfare, just the way it's implemented. The apartment where I currently live has basically been bribed by the government to rent out tons of its rooms to homeless, and almost every women among them has at least two children at their feet at all times and are pregnant. It is my belief that welfare recipients should receive free birth control and condoms and that they can enter welfare while pregnant and while they have children. However if they become pregnant while on welfare they are either taken off welfare altogether or they must have an abortion. UPDATE: Ok, view changed 30 degrees by Feathering. My modified view is that having kids on welfare won't mean it is revoked from you but it won't raise whatsoever. So every kid will stretch the budget thinner, thus motivation to stop having more children. UPDATE: I am now pro required birth control for anyone on welfare with a 1 strike policy. If they have a child while on welfare and not get it aborted, if they still want welfare they need to voluntarily be TEMPORARILY sterilized(IE a procedure that can be undone after they no longer draw from welfare). So not punishing the children, only the adults. UPDATE: View Changed. Thank You for all of your comments. I am really glad you took the effort to convince me otherwise of my view, which even disgusted me a bit. This sub is awesome.  the CMV moderators.","The assumption that individuals who have children while on welfare are somehow less capable of supporting themselves or their families is a stigmatizing and inaccurate portrayal of people in poverty. Research has consistently shown that the primary causes of poverty are systemic, including limited access to education, job opportunities, and affordable healthcare, rather than personal failures or lack of motivation. Furthermore, expecting individuals to rely on birth control as a primary means of poverty prevention overlooks the reality of reproductive coercion, trauma, and limited access to reproductive healthcare faced by many women, particularly those in low-income communities. In fact, studies have found that the most effective way to reduce poverty is to invest in education, job training, and economic opportunities that allow individuals to break the cycle of poverty.

Moreover, the focus on individual behavior and ""responsible"" reproductive choices ignores the ways in which structural barriers, such as housing insecurity, food insecurity, and lack of access to healthcare, can limit an individual's ability to plan for the future or make choices about their reproductive health. The emphasis on punishment and sterilization as a means of ""motivating"" individuals to avoid having children while on welfare is not only coercive and morally problematic but also ignores the fact that many individuals on welfare are already doing their best to navigate the system and provide for themselves and their families. In fact, research has shown that welfare programs that focus on supporting and empowering individuals, rather than punishing or stigmatizing them, are more effective at promoting economic mobility and breaking the cycle of poverty.

Ultimately, the approach advocated by the original author would only serve to further marginalize and stigmatize individuals who are already vulnerable, rather than addressing the underlying causes of poverty and promoting meaningful solutions. By prioritizing empathy, understanding, and a nuanced understanding of the complex factors driving poverty, we can work towards creating a more just and equitable society that supports the well-being and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their reproductive choices or socioeconomic status.","The idea of withholding benefits from individuals who have children while on welfare overlooks the harsh realities of poverty and the complexities of human decision-making. People living in poverty often face difficult choices, including whether to prioritize short-term needs or long-term goals. Rather than viewing welfare recipients as ""undeserving,"" it's more productive to recognize the systemic issues that lead to poverty and to develop policies that address these root causes. For example, providing free birth control and reproductive education can empower individuals to make informed decisions about their reproductive health, rather than relying on punitive measures that stigmatize those who are struggling.

Moreover, the assumption that people who are on welfare are having children as a means of exploiting the system is an unfair generalization. Many individuals on welfare are single mothers who are doing their best to provide for their children, despite the significant barriers they face. Denying them benefits or subjecting them to punitive measures like sterilization would only exacerbate these challenges and perpetuate cycles of poverty. By contrast, providing access to affordable childcare, education, and job training can help low-income individuals become self-sufficient and break the cycle of poverty.

It's also worth considering the long-term consequences of such policies. Research has shown that punitive measures, such as removing benefits for those who have children while on welfare, can lead to increased poverty rates and reduced economic mobility. This is because individuals who are struggling to make ends meet are often forced to make difficult choices, such as forgoing medical care or education, in order to maintain their benefits. By contrast, a more comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty can lead to more sustainable and equitable outcomes for all.

Ultimately, rather than relying on punitive measures, we should focus on creating a system that supports and empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their reproductive health and well-being. By doing so, we can work towards a more just and equitable society that prioritizes the needs of vulnerable populations, including low-income families.","The proposal to revoke or limit welfare benefits for individuals who become pregnant while receiving assistance is a simplistic solution that fails to acknowledge the intricate web of social determinants that drive poverty and reproductive choices. Rather than addressing the root causes of poverty, such as lack of affordable housing, limited access to education and job opportunities, and inadequate healthcare, this approach would only exacerbate the problem. Women and families living in poverty often have limited access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare, including birth control and prenatal care, which can lead to unplanned pregnancies. Moreover, the lack of affordable childcare options, housing, and economic stability can make it difficult for women to choose when and if they become parents, often resulting in unintended pregnancies.

Furthermore, the notion that individuals on welfare are somehow ""taking advantage"" of the system is a stigmatizing and inaccurate stereotype. Research has shown that the vast majority of welfare recipients are not freeloaders, but rather individuals and families who are struggling to make ends meet due to circumstances beyond their control. In fact, many women on welfare are single mothers who are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, yet still struggle to afford basic necessities. The idea that they should be ""punished"" for having children while receiving assistance ignores the very real challenges they face and the systemic barriers that prevent them from accessing economic stability.

Rather than revoking or limiting benefits, a more effective approach would be to provide comprehensive support services, including reproductive health education, birth control, and access to affordable childcare and housing. This would enable individuals and families to make informed choices about their reproductive health and economic stability, rather than being forced to rely on punitive measures that only serve to further marginalize and stigmatize those who are already vulnerable. By prioritizing support and empowerment, rather than punishment and control, we can work towards creating a more just and equitable society that values the well-being of all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status.","The argument for revoking welfare benefits for individuals who have children while on assistance assumes a binary choice between individual responsibility and government support. However, this dichotomy ignores the reality that many people rely on welfare due to systemic failures in education, housing, and employment opportunities. The current system often leaves families without access to affordable childcare, healthcare, or stable employment, forcing them into poverty and reliance on government assistance. Rather than focusing on punitive measures, policymakers should prioritize addressing these underlying causes of poverty and investing in programs that support family well-being. This could include initiatives such as universal childcare, paid parental leave, and job training programs that enable individuals to gain the skills and resources needed to escape poverty and thrive economically. By acknowledging the complex interplay between individual circumstances and structural barriers, policymakers can develop more effective solutions that promote economic mobility and reduce reliance on welfare benefits.","The assumption that people who have children while on welfare are irresponsible or unmotivated is a stigmatizing narrative that overlooks the structural barriers many families face. Welfare recipients are not simply ""choosing"" to have more children; they may be struggling to access reliable birth control, facing socioeconomic pressures to have multiple children, or dealing with trauma and stress that can impact reproductive health. In addition, the proposed policy of temporarily sterilizing individuals who have children while on welfare is a draconian measure that raises serious human rights concerns. Such policies also ignore the fact that people on welfare are often already marginalized and vulnerable populations, including low-income communities of color, immigrants, and those with disabilities. A more compassionate approach would be to provide universal access to reproductive healthcare, education, and economic opportunities that enable individuals to make choices about their families without fear of punishment or stigma.","The proposed policy of revoking welfare benefits for individuals who have children while on assistance oversimplifies the complexities of poverty and family planning. While it is true that some families may choose to have multiple children to receive more financial support, this is not a universal truth. Many people on welfare are not trying to exploit the system but rather are struggling to make ends meet due to circumstances beyond their control. For instance, single mothers who are victims of domestic violence or abuse may be forced into poverty and unable to access reproductive healthcare. Furthermore, children born into poverty often face significant barriers to education, health, and economic mobility, which can perpetuate the cycle of poverty. Rather than punishing individuals for having children while on welfare, policymakers should focus on providing comprehensive support services that empower families to make informed choices about their reproductive health. This could include access to affordable healthcare, education, and job training programs."
t3_98lkjz,"Transgenderism is an emotional system, not a biological one For many years, we have accepted the idea of 2 genders. Male, and female. We have used the words sex and gender synonymously. The whole idea of transgenderism is an emotional appeal, where they wish to be another gender, with no obvious biological proofs. Yes, oddities exist. Hermaphrodites and intersex are proof of that, however we've never considered them normal. We've always treated oddities as oddities, not accepted them and even bend society and laws for their sake. It's also a difficult system to adapt to as concepts of misgendering now exist. We now have to be extra careful before approaching someone, or else, if for example in Canada, Bill C-16 makes it a hate crime to misgender if the recipient feels offense, which is also difficult. Concepts like cultural appropriation and micro aggressions exist, and it's difficult to find what's offensive because it's not a set rule state, it's ridiculously subjective. Now I don't call for violence or anything against transgender people. I just don't accept being forced into their system. I would like you all to change my mind in terms of transgenderism.","The argument that adapting to concepts like cultural appropriation, microaggressions, and misgendering is an onerous burden overlooks the fundamental principle of treating individuals with respect and dignity. Misgendering can be a form of violence for transgender individuals who have experienced marginalization throughout their lives. Moreover, research has demonstrated that acknowledging and respecting people's gender identities can lead to positive outcomes in mental health and overall well-being. The suggestion that there is no clear rule or standard governing these concepts ignores the fact that human behavior and interactions are inherently context-dependent. In reality, social norms and expectations can evolve rapidly as new perspectives and understanding emerge. What may seem subjective at first glance often becomes more intuitive with continued exposure to diverse experiences and viewpoints. Rather than resisting this change, it's essential to recognize the value in striving for inclusivity and sensitivity in our interactions with others. The acceptance of transgenderism is a crucial step towards fostering a society that values respect, compassion, and understanding above all else.","The assertion that recognizing two traditional genders has been a universally accepted norm is inaccurate. There are numerous cultures around the world where non-binary or third-gender identities are acknowledged and respected without controversy. For instance, in some Indigenous Australian communities, there exists a recognition of individuals who embody both masculine and feminine qualities without necessarily identifying as either male or female. These diverse perspectives challenge the idea that binary gender is an absolute truth. Moreover, research has consistently shown that sex characteristics can be incredibly nuanced, with intersex conditions affecting approximately 1 in every 2,000 births. The assumption that oddities are inherently abnormal ignores the fact that human biology is inherently varied and complex. In many cases, individuals who identify as transgender experience their identity as an essential aspect of their being, not merely a emotional preference. Rather than dismissing these experiences as invalid or attention-seeking, it's crucial to acknowledge the legitimacy of diverse gender identities and expressions within our society.","The assumption that transgenderism is an emotional system rather than a biological one oversimplifies the complex experiences of individuals who identify as transgender. While it may be true that some people's experiences with their gender are not immediately apparent through physical examination, this does not negate the fact that many transgender individuals undergo rigorous self-examination and exploration to understand their own identities. The existence of intersex conditions highlights the complexities of human biology but does not serve as evidence for dismissing the validity of transgender identity. Furthermore, medical professionals have recognized intersex conditions for decades, yet they continue to develop and refine the understanding of these conditions through ongoing research. In contrast, the concept of transgenderism has only recently gained recognition within mainstream medicine. Moreover, transgender individuals often experience significant distress when their identity is not acknowledged or respected. The argument that forcing society to adapt to a new system is an unreasonable demand overlooks the historical precedent for social change and human rights advancements. Many marginalized groups have faced similar challenges in seeking acceptance and equality. Ultimately, dismissing transgenderism as solely an emotional appeal neglects the intricate interplay between emotions, identity, and lived experience.","The concept of gender is far more complex and multifaceted than a simple binary system. While it is true that hermaphrodites and intersex individuals exist, this does not necessarily mean that they are anomalies or oddities. In fact, research has shown that intersex individuals are more common than previously thought, and that they often face significant challenges and marginalization due to societal expectations and norms. The psychologist's work in media and storytelling highlights the power of narratives to shape our understanding of identity and reality, and it is precisely this kind of storytelling that has contributed to the growing recognition and acceptance of transgender individuals.

Moreover, the idea that transgenderism is an emotional appeal, rather than a biological one, is a simplistic and reductionist view that fails to account for the complexity of human experience. Research has shown that transgender individuals often experience significant distress and marginalization due to their non-conforming gender identity, and that this distress is often rooted in societal expectations and norms rather than any inherent flaw in their identity. By denying the validity of transgender experiences and identities, we risk perpetuating this marginalization and exacerbating the very real emotional and psychological harms that transgender individuals face.

Furthermore, the concern about adapting to a more inclusive understanding of gender is not necessarily about imposing a new system, but rather about recognizing and respecting the diversity of human experience. In many cultures and societies, gender is not seen as a binary concept, but rather as a complex and multifaceted aspect of human identity. By learning to navigate and appreciate this diversity, we can create a more inclusive and compassionate society that values the well-being and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity.

In terms of the challenges of misgendering and cultural appropriation, these are real concerns that require careful consideration and education. However, they are not unique to the issue of transgenderism, and can be addressed through open and respectful dialogue, education, and training. By working together to create a more inclusive and empathetic society, we can reduce the risk of misgendering and cultural appropriation, and create a more positive and supportive environment for all individuals.

Ultimately, the psychologist's work highlights the importance of empathy, compassion, and understanding in creating a more inclusive and supportive society. By listening to the stories and experiences of transgender individuals, and by recognizing the complexity and diversity of human identity, we can create a more nuanced and compassionate understanding of the complexities surrounding transgenderism.","The notion that transgenderism is solely an emotional system, lacking biological proof, overlooks the complexity of human experience and the evolving nature of our understanding of the human body. While it is true that intersex individuals and hermaphrodites exist, they do not negate the fact that transgender individuals experience a deep-seated sense of their gender identity that does not align with their assigned sex at birth. This sense of self is not merely an emotional response, but a fundamental aspect of one's identity, akin to the way individuals experience and express their racial or ethnic identities. The idea that we should dismiss this aspect of human experience as ""emotional"" or ""subjective"" is a reduction of the complexity of human emotions and the multifaceted nature of identity.

Furthermore, the argument that accepting transgenderism would lead to social chaos and confusion is a self-fulfilling prophecy. The fact that we now have to be mindful of concepts like misgendering and cultural appropriation is not a result of the transgender movement, but rather a natural consequence of a society that is beginning to acknowledge and respect the diversity of human experience. In fact, studies have shown that when individuals are allowed to express themselves authentically, they experience increased mental health and well-being, and are more likely to be productive members of society.

It is also worth noting that the idea of clear boundaries and traditional understanding of gender has not always been a fixed or universal concept. In fact, many cultures have historically recognized a range of gender identities and expressions that are now being rediscovered and celebrated. The notion that we must adhere to a narrow and static understanding of gender is a recent and Western construct, and one that has been used to marginalize and oppress marginalized communities.

Ultimately, the refusal to accept transgenderism as a legitimate aspect of human experience is not only a rejection of the diversity of human identity, but also a refusal to engage with the complexities of the human condition. By acknowledging and respecting the experiences of transgender individuals, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting society, one that values and celebrates the diversity of human experience, rather than seeking to constrain it within narrow and outdated norms.","Understanding and accepting transgender individuals is not about forcing a system, but rather about acknowledging and valuing the complexities of human experience. The concept of two binary genders has been widely accepted for years, but that does not make it the only truth. In fact, many cultures and societies throughout history have recognized more than two genders, each with its own unique identity and expression. This is not about tearing down traditional norms, but about expanding our understanding of what it means to be human.

By embracing the diversity of gender identities, the entertainment industry can tap into a rich tapestry of stories and experiences that resonate with a broad and diverse audience. In fact, many successful films and TV shows have already explored complex and nuanced portrayals of transgender characters, showcasing the richness and diversity of their experiences. For example, shows like ""Sense8"" and ""Transparent"" have garnered critical acclaim for their thoughtful and authentic portrayals of transgender characters, and have helped to promote a more inclusive and accepting environment for LGBTQ individuals.

Rather than viewing transgenderism as an emotional system, we can see it as an opportunity to explore the complexities of human identity and experience. This is not about forcing individuals to conform to societal norms, but about creating a more inclusive and accepting environment that values diversity and individuality. By embracing this diversity, the entertainment industry can create more authentic and compelling stories that resonate with a broader audience and promote greater understanding and empathy.

Moreover, the idea that concepts like cultural appropriation and microaggressions are subjective is a red herring. While it is true that cultural appropriation and microaggressions can be complex and nuanced, this does not mean that they are not real or that they do not have a negative impact on marginalized communities. In fact, many artists and creators have successfully navigated these complexities by being thoughtful, sensitive, and respectful in their portrayals of diverse cultures and experiences. By being mindful of these issues, the entertainment industry can create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.

Ultimately, the entertainment industry has a unique opportunity to promote greater understanding and acceptance of transgender individuals and the diversity of gender identities. By embracing this diversity, we can create more authentic and compelling stories that resonate with a broader audience and promote greater empathy and understanding. This is not about forcing a system, but about valuing the complexities of human experience and promoting a more inclusive and accepting environment for all."
t3_93s0r0,"boneless wings are just chicken nuggets. chickens have bones in their wings so therefore chicken wings should be served with the bones still intact. chicken nuggets are just clumps of chicken, without bones, and are not classified as wings. boneless wings are just chicken nuggets, in all senses. boneless wings are referred to as boneless wings so adults will be more open to eating chicken nuggets. chicken nuggets are seen as a childish meal so boneless wings are essentially a term used to trick individuals into purchasing overpriced chicken nuggets.","The assertion that boneless wings are nothing more than chicken nuggets overlooks the culinary creativity and innovation that goes into crafting this dish. Boneless wings are a masterclass in texture and flavor, with chefs carefully selecting and preparing the tenderest parts of the chicken to create a unique and satisfying eating experience. The process of de-boning and marinating these parts requires a high level of skill and expertise, which is not typically associated with mass-produced chicken nuggets. Furthermore, the use of herbs and spices in boneless wings is often more complex and nuanced than in traditional chicken nuggets, adding a depth of flavor that is hard to replicate with processed ingredients.

Moreover, the cultural context of boneless wings is rooted in the rich culinary traditions of global cuisine, particularly in Korean and Southeast Asian cooking, where boneless chicken is a staple ingredient. In these cultures, the focus is on the art of cooking and the joy of sharing food with others, rather than on the nutritional content or marketing labels. By embracing the diversity of global cuisine, chefs and restaurants can create dishes that are both delicious and innovative, rather than relying on processed ingredients and misleading labels.

It is also worth noting that the term ""boneless wings"" is not necessarily meant to deceive consumers, but rather to provide a descriptive label for a unique dish that defies traditional culinary categorization. The fact that adults are willing to pay a premium for boneless wings is a testament to the growing demand for high-quality, expertly prepared food that is both satisfying and enjoyable. Rather than viewing this as a marketing ploy, it would be more productive to see it as a reflection of a growing appreciation for the culinary arts and the value that skilled chefs bring to the table.","The notion that boneless wings are merely chicken nuggets in disguise neglects the profound impact of culinary innovation on cultural identity and nostalgia. When we indulge in boneless wings, we are not merely consuming a processed food, but participating in a communal experience that transcends the confines of traditional culinary norms. The love for boneless wings is a testament to human creativity and adaptability, rather than a sign of gullibility or a susceptibility to marketing tactics. By embracing the art of culinary innovation, we can foster a deeper appreciation for the ways in which food can bring people together, even if it means pushing the boundaries of traditional definitions.

Moreover, the notion that boneless wings are simply a marketing ploy to sell overpriced chicken nuggets overlooks the significance of the cultural context in which they emerged. Boneless wings have become a staple in many cuisines, particularly in urban areas where space and convenience are at a premium. In these environments, the boneless wing has become a symbol of community and conviviality, a testament to the resourcefulness and creativity of urban dwellers who have adapted traditional recipes to suit their needs. By dismissing boneless wings as merely chicken nuggets, we risk losing sight of the rich cultural heritage that underlies this culinary innovation.

Furthermore, the argument that boneless wings are a childish meal option misunderstands the complex and multifaceted nature of culinary experience. Food is not simply a matter of nutritional value or authenticity, but a deeply personal and emotional experience that can evoke powerful memories and associations. When we partake in a meal, we are not just consuming sustenance, but participating in a ritual that connects us to our past, our culture, and our community. By recognizing the cultural significance of boneless wings, we can appreciate the ways in which food can transcend the boundaries of age, class, and identity.

Ultimately, the argument against boneless wings reflects a narrow and reductionist view of culinary innovation, one that prioritizes authenticity over creativity and tradition over progress. By embracing the diversity and adaptability of culinary culture, we can foster a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between food, culture, and identity.","The notion that boneless wings are simply chicken nuggets in disguise is an oversimplification that neglects the complexities of culinary innovation. In reality, the preparation and presentation of boneless wings often differ significantly from those of traditional chicken nuggets. For instance, boneless wings are frequently breaded and deep-fried in a way that creates a crispy exterior and a tender interior, whereas chicken nuggets tend to be mass-produced and cooked en masse. Moreover, the term ""boneless wings"" has become an integral part of popular culture, evoking a specific image and experience that transcends the humble chicken nugget.

Furthermore, the assumption that adults are tricked into purchasing overpriced chicken nuggets under the guise of boneless wings is not only cynical but also fails to account for the nuances of consumer behavior. Many adults actively seek out boneless wings as a convenient and indulgent option, and the term has become synonymous with a certain level of quality and expertise in cooking. In fact, some restaurants have successfully rebranded traditional chicken nuggets as ""boneless wings"" to highlight their commitment to creative cuisine and customer satisfaction.

In the context of the food industry, the marketing of boneless wings has proven to be a savvy move that has helped to reinvigorate the market and attract a new generation of customers. By embracing this trend, restaurants and food establishments can tap into the nostalgia and sentimentality that adults associate with the term ""boneless wings,"" while also showcasing their culinary skills and creativity. Ultimately, the distinction between boneless wings and chicken nuggets lies not in the ingredients, but in the experience and presentation, and it is this intangible aspect that has made boneless wings a staple in modern dining culture.","The argument that boneless wings are simply chicken nuggets due to their lack of bones assumes a rigid definition of what constitutes a wing. However, food terminology often reflects cultural and culinary conventions rather than strict definitions. In many Asian cuisines, for example, meat is frequently deboned before cooking to make it more palatable. The term ""boneless wings"" likely originated as a marketing strategy to rebrand chicken nuggets in a way that appeals to adults who may be hesitant to order something they perceive as childish.

A closer examination of the term ""wing"" reveals that it refers primarily to the cut and presentation of the meat, rather than its anatomical composition. This is evident in dishes like chicken breast tenders or riblets, which are often referred to as wings despite not resembling actual avian wings. By this logic, boneless wings can be seen as a legitimate variation on the traditional wing theme.

Moreover, the argument that boneless wings are used to trick consumers into buying overpriced chicken nuggets relies on a cynicism towards marketing and consumer psychology. While it is true that some restaurants may employ such tactics, it oversimplifies the complexity of culinary branding and customer preferences.","The criticism that boneless wings are simply a marketing ploy designed to sell overpriced chicken nuggets misses the point that food terminology is often influenced by cultural and social factors. In many social settings, such as sporting events or casual gatherings, boneless wings have become an accepted and even expected item on menus.

This cultural acceptance of boneless wings suggests that they are more than just a marketing gimmick, but rather a reflection of shifting culinary norms and preferences. Rather than being seen as a trick to sell nuggets, boneless wings can be viewed as a legitimate innovation in the world of chicken dishes.

Moreover, the focus on what constitutes an actual ""wing"" distracts from the more relevant issue of flavor profile and texture. Boneless wings often offer unique flavor combinations and textures that cannot be replicated with traditional nuggets or even whole wings. By dismissing boneless wings as mere nuggets, food critics overlook the culinary value and diversity they bring to the table.","The notion that boneless wings are merely a euphemism for chicken nuggets neglects the significant differences in preparation and presentation between the two. Boneless wings are typically made from a single piece of meat, cut into strips or cubes and breaded before being deep-fried or baked. In contrast, chicken nuggets often consist of reconstituted poultry product, bound together with additives to create a uniform texture.

The breading and cooking process for boneless wings also sets them apart from traditional nuggets. A well-made boneless wing will have a crispy exterior and a juicy interior, while a nugget is more likely to be dense and dry. These differences in preparation and presentation justify the distinct categorization of boneless wings as a unique culinary item.

Furthermore, the argument that adults are tricked into ordering boneless wings because they resemble chicken nuggets assumes a limited understanding of adult consumers' preferences and dietary habits. Many people choose to order boneless wings precisely because they offer a variation on traditional wing flavors without the bones or mess."
t3_8det7m,"People who order Decaf Black Coffee either hate themselves, or have no sense of taste Now I work at a place where I am the cashier and also get to make drinks for any orders that involve them, and lots of the time I get orders for Black Coffee, which is okay by me, I get that some people only order Coffee to wake up and they believe that Black Coffee is the most potent, I also know that some people don't put anything in the coffee in fear of calories as well, so that's okay if you would like to wake up. Now here is my argument, Decaf Coffee is.. Well... Not designed to wake you up... So.. What is even the point of ordering it Black? It tastes horrid, and drinking it is torture in my books. And if you're about to tell me that they put cream and sugar in it later on, I see them drinking it right away
So can someone please explain to me what the point is? Maybe I'm missing something.","The argument against ordering decaf black coffee relies heavily on a subjective evaluation of its appeal and purpose. However, such an assessment fails to consider the social context and emotional significance attached to this beverage choice. For instance, some people may associate decaf black coffee with feelings of comfort, relaxation, or nostalgia. Perhaps they have fond memories of enjoying decaf coffee in a particular setting or with specific company. Alternatively, individuals might choose decaf black coffee as part of their daily routine to establish a sense of familiarity and predictability in an otherwise chaotic environment. Moreover, the assumption that people order decaf black coffee solely for its flavor profile neglects the role of ritualistic behavior in shaping consumption patterns. The act of ordering decaf black coffee can be seen as a deliberate attempt to create structure and meaning in one's life, even if this particular beverage choice may not align with societal norms or personal taste preferences. By dismissing individuals who order decaf black coffee without consideration for their unique circumstances, the original argument inadvertently reinforces a culture of judgment and conformity.","The assumption that people who order decaf black coffee either hate themselves or have no sense of taste is a narrow and judgmental perspective. It overlooks the complexities of human behavior and experience. Decaf black coffee can be a deliberate choice for individuals who are sensitive to caffeine, pregnant women, or those with certain medical conditions. Moreover, it's possible that people order decaf black coffee simply because they prefer its flavor profile over regular coffee or other beverages. The notion that decaf black coffee is only consumed by individuals without taste buds ignores the existence of diverse palates and preferences. People may also choose decaf black coffee as a way to reduce their caffeine intake gradually, allowing them to transition from regular coffee consumption. Furthermore, ordering decaf black coffee can be seen as an exercise in self-regulation and moderation, demonstrating a person's ability to control their habits and make informed choices. Rather than viewing this behavior as absurd or lacking taste, it might be more productive to acknowledge the individual's autonomy and agency over their dietary preferences. It is essential to recognize that personal taste and consumption patterns can vary greatly across individuals and cultures.","The notion that people who order decaf black coffee hate themselves or have no sense of taste relies on an overly simplistic understanding of human motivation. Research in psychology has shown that food choices often involve complex emotional, social, and environmental factors. For instance, individuals may choose to order decaf black coffee as a way to cope with stress, anxiety, or other negative emotions associated with caffeine consumption. Alternatively, they might be attempting to make healthier lifestyle choices, even if this means sacrificing personal preference for the sake of well-being. Furthermore, some people may experience physical sensitivities or discomforts in response to caffeine, making decaf black coffee a necessary choice rather than a matter of taste. Rather than viewing these individuals as weak-willed or lacking in self-awareness, it is essential to recognize that people's relationships with food and beverages are multifaceted and influenced by various factors beyond personal preference. By acknowledging the diversity of human experiences and motivations, we can foster a more empathetic understanding of why some individuals might choose to order decaf black coffee.","Decaf Black Coffee may not be your cup of tea, but for many people, it serves a purpose beyond mere taste. In some cultures, decaf coffee is not merely a substitute for regular coffee but an integral part of traditional coffee ceremonies and rituals. For example, in Ethiopia, where coffee originated, decaf coffee is a staple in many households, particularly during certain spiritual and social gatherings. It's not about waking up or getting a caffeine boost; it's about the social bonding and cultural significance attached to the act of sharing a cup of coffee, regardless of its caffeine content.

Moreover, some people order decaf coffee not out of a lack of sense of taste or a desire to torture themselves but because they're sensitive to caffeine or have certain health conditions that require them to avoid it. In such cases, decaf coffee provides a comforting alternative that allows them to participate in the social ritual of coffee consumption without worrying about adverse effects. The fact that they might drink it immediately without adding cream or sugar doesn't mean they don't appreciate its flavor; perhaps they simply enjoy the taste of decaf coffee as is.

Furthermore, the notion that decaf coffee tastes ""horrid"" or is torture to drink is subjective and overlooks the variety of roasting methods, brewing techniques, and flavor profiles available in the market. Decaf coffee can be just as rich and complex as its regular counterpart, and many coffee connoisseurs appreciate its unique characteristics. By dismissing decaf coffee as a poor alternative, you're inadvertently dismissing the diverse experiences and preferences of those who enjoy it. Rather than viewing decaf coffee as a non-entity, perhaps we should strive to understand and appreciate the cultural, social, and personal significance it holds for many people.","Decaf Black Coffee, despite its potential lack of potency, can serve a distinct purpose for individuals who value its characteristics. For some, it may be about savoring the taste and aroma without the caffeine's stimulating effects. This could be attributed to personal taste preferences, health concerns, or even cultural backgrounds where decaf is the norm. Others may opt for decaf black coffee due to its lower acidity, which can be beneficial for those sensitive to the stomach-churning effects of regular coffee.

Moreover, consider the notion that the intention behind ordering decaf black coffee may not be solely about its taste. Perhaps it's a ritualistic experience, a moment to pause and appreciate the simple act of drinking coffee without any additives. It could be a deliberate choice to slow down and enjoy the sensory experience, much like how actors immerse themselves in their characters. This mindfulness aspect can be just as valuable as the caffeine content itself.

Additionally, the perception of decaf black coffee's taste can be subjective. What one person considers ""horrid"" might be exactly what another person finds enjoyable. Taste is a highly personal aspect of human experience, influenced by genetics, environment, and cultural conditioning. It's unfair to generalize that decaf black coffee tastes bad or is only for those who hate themselves.

Furthermore, in the context of a coffee shop, decaf black coffee can be a reflection of the customer's values and priorities. Some people may choose decaf over regular coffee as a statement about their desire for a healthier lifestyle or their appreciation for the nuances of coffee without the caffeine kick. By acknowledging and respecting these choices, coffee shops can foster a more inclusive environment that caters to diverse customer needs.

Ultimately, the decision to order decaf black coffee is not solely about the coffee itself, but about the individual's preferences, values, and experiences. By embracing this complexity, we can move beyond our own biases and create a more empathetic understanding of the diverse coffee drinkers who walk through our doors.","The notion that people who order decaf black coffee have no sense of taste or must hate themselves is a narrow-minded perspective that dismisses the complexity of human experience. It assumes that people are either black-and-white in their preferences or lack a certain level of sophistication. However, the world of art and design is filled with examples of restraint and subtlety, where simplicity is used to convey meaning and evoke emotions. In the same vein, decaf black coffee can be seen as a deliberate choice, a design decision that values clarity and intention over additives and distractions.

When we consider the minimalist approach in art, architecture, and design, we find that simplicity is often used to highlight the essence of a form or experience. Decaf black coffee can be seen as a similar exercise in minimalism, stripping away the extraneous to reveal the fundamental qualities of the coffee itself. This choice can be a reflection of a desire for clarity, a rejection of excess, or a celebration of the beauty in simplicity. It's possible that those who order decaf black coffee are not trying to torture themselves, but rather, they're making a deliberate choice to experience the coffee in its purest form.

Furthermore, the idea that people only order decaf black coffee to wake up is an oversimplification of human behavior. Humans are complex beings with diverse motivations and preferences. Some may choose decaf black coffee for its flavor profile, its low acidity, or its suitability for certain dietary needs. Others may appreciate its aesthetic qualities, such as the way the light passes through the cup or the simplicity of the design.

In the world of art and design, we often celebrate the subjective and the personal. We recognize that people have different tastes and preferences, and that's what makes the world interesting. By dismissing those who order decaf black coffee as somehow lacking, we overlook the beauty of diversity and individuality. Instead, we should celebrate the choices people make, even if they don't align with our own preferences."
t3_251sp2,"Deliberately increasing your caloric intake to add muscle (""bulking"") leads to obesity later in life. The idea is that deliberately overeating will build eating habits that will be difficult to change later, when you are working a desk job and being a dad and not burning off those calories. This would not apply to celebrities whose job includes shaping their bodies and people with sufficient self-control that they are never tempted to keep eating the slab of ribs until they're gone. But it happens to former football players all the time. One premise I have that you might not share is that losing weight is just about impossible once you have gained it. There is no scientifically approved diet that you can follow and it will work. This is why any weight gain that disrupts a body with a nice, working non-obese equilibrium is very risky. In sum: like tanning, bulking is something that increases your relative status but is bad for your body in the long run.","The assertion that deliberately increasing caloric intake for muscle gain inevitably leads to obesity later in life neglects the complexity of human physiology and behavior. Research indicates that individuals with a high muscle mass tend to have increased resting metabolic rates, which can help mitigate weight gain over time. Furthermore, studies have shown that even moderate levels of resistance training can lead to long-term improvements in insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, making it easier for individuals to maintain a healthy weight. The idea that bulking necessarily disrupts a body's equilibrium is overstated, as muscle gain can actually enhance overall physical function and efficiency. In fact, many athletes and fitness enthusiasts who have successfully bulked up their physiques report improved overall health and reduced rates of chronic disease compared to sedentary individuals. A more nuanced understanding of the relationships between muscle mass, metabolism, and weight management is necessary before concluding that bulking is uniformly detrimental.","The claim that celebrities and athletes who bulk up their physiques do so in a vacuum of self-control and discipline is misleading. Many professional athletes have spoken publicly about the importance of balancing muscle gain with careful attention to nutrition and training, highlighting the need for deliberate and strategic approaches to bulking. Similarly, certain celebrities who have been open about their fitness journeys report using bulking as a means of achieving specific health goals, such as recovering from injury or improving overall physical function. By recognizing that even high-profile individuals engage in responsible and informed weight management practices, it is possible to reframe the discussion around bulking away from fear-mongering and toward more constructive conversations about evidence-based approaches to fitness and nutrition. Ultimately, promoting a culture of healthy and intentional weight gain can help shift societal attitudes toward body positivity and greater acceptance of diverse physical appearances.","The notion that losing weight once it has been gained is impossible may be an oversimplification of a highly variable human experience. While it is true that some diets have not been scientifically proven to be effective for long-term weight loss, many others have been shown to promote sustained weight reduction in conjunction with regular physical activity. Moreover, numerous case studies and anecdotal accounts suggest that people who have bulked up and subsequently lost weight through careful dieting and exercise often report a greater sense of discipline and self-awareness regarding their eating habits than before. Rather than dismissing bulking as inherently counterproductive, it may be more productive to focus on developing strategies for maintaining healthy habits in the face of changing lifestyles, such as finding ways to stay active and engaged with nutrition during periods of reduced physical activity. By adopting a more flexible and adaptive approach to weight management, individuals can mitigate the risks associated with bulking up.","Bulking is often misunderstood as a one-size-fits-all approach that inevitably leads to obesity, but the reality is far more nuanced. While it is true that some individuals may struggle to maintain weight loss after bulking, others successfully adapt and manage their weight, even in the face of changing circumstances. For instance, a study on former professional athletes found that many were able to maintain a healthy weight after retirement, despite a significant decrease in physical activity. Furthermore, research on genetically predisposed individuals has shown that certain genetic markers can protect against weight gain, even when caloric intake exceeds recommendations.

Moreover, the author's assertion that losing weight is ""just about impossible"" once gained is an oversimplification of a complex issue. While it is true that weight loss can be challenging, numerous scientific studies have identified effective strategies for maintaining weight loss, such as mindful eating, regular physical activity, and stress management. In fact, a review of over 50 clinical trials found that structured weight loss programs, combined with behavioral support, can lead to significant and sustained weight loss in a substantial proportion of participants.

Rather than viewing bulking as a high-risk endeavor, it can be seen as a critical aspect of overall health and wellness, particularly for individuals who are underweight or struggling with disordered eating. By allowing individuals to set and achieve fitness goals, bulking can boost self-esteem, confidence, and overall quality of life. Furthermore, a well-planned bulking cycle can provide an opportunity for individuals to develop healthy eating habits, such as increased protein intake and meal frequency, which can translate to long-term weight management.

Ultimately, the key to successful bulking and weight management lies not in the activity itself, but in the individual's ability to make informed choices and adapt to changing circumstances. By acknowledging the complexity of real-world situations and the unique factors that influence weight management, we can work towards a more inclusive and supportive approach to health and fitness, one that values individual differences and promotes long-term success.","The notion that bulking inevitably leads to obesity and is therefore a high-risk strategy is an oversimplification of the complex relationship between caloric intake and muscle growth. While it is true that overeating can lead to weight gain and obesity, it is equally true that a well-planned and controlled bulking regimen can lead to significant improvements in overall health and physique. For individuals who are looking to increase their muscle mass, a period of deliberate overeating may be necessary to support muscle growth and development. By focusing solely on the risks of bulking, the author overlooks the potential benefits of this approach, including increased strength, improved bone density, and enhanced athletic performance.

Moreover, the idea that weight loss is impossible once weight has been gained is not entirely accurate. While it is true that some diets may not be effective for everyone, there are many evidence-based approaches to weight loss that can be highly effective when combined with a healthy and balanced lifestyle. A well-planned bulking regimen can actually make it easier to lose weight in the long run, as the increased muscle mass can help to boost metabolism and support weight loss efforts.

It is also worth noting that the author's assertion that only celebrities and individuals with sufficient self-control can avoid the pitfalls of bulking is not necessarily true. Many individuals can successfully engage in bulking and then maintain their weight and muscle mass through a combination of careful planning, regular exercise, and a balanced diet. By focusing on the negative aspects of bulking, the author neglects the potential benefits of this approach and fails to acknowledge the many individuals who have successfully used bulking to achieve their fitness goals.","The notion that deliberately increasing caloric intake for the purpose of muscle gain inevitably leads to obesity in the long run may be an oversimplification of the complexities of human physiology. As an entomologist, it is clear that ecosystems are shaped by countless variables, and the human body is no exception. Rather than viewing the relationship between caloric intake and body composition as a linear one, it is more accurate to consider it as a dynamic and multifaceted interaction between genetics, lifestyle, and environment. The author's assertion that losing weight is impossible once gained relies on a flawed assumption that there is a single, universally applicable solution for weight management.

In reality, there is a vast array of diets and exercise regimens that can be effective for weight loss, and the success of these interventions can depend on a wide range of factors, including individual metabolism, starting body composition, and overall health status. Furthermore, the author's assertion that bulking is inherently bad for the body in the long run is not supported by scientific evidence. In fact, many studies have shown that resistance training and caloric surplus can lead to significant improvements in cardiovascular health, insulin sensitivity, and bone density, even in the absence of weight loss. It is also worth noting that the author's claim that former football players are prone to obesity after bulking may be a correlation rather than a causation, and does not provide conclusive evidence for the notion that bulking leads to obesity.

Moreover, the idea that one's eating habits and lifestyle are fixed and unchangeable is a form of fatalism that is not supported by scientific evidence. Humans are capable of adapting to a wide range of environments and situations, and it is entirely possible for individuals to develop healthy eating habits and exercise routines that are sustainable in the long term. In fact, the author's own assertion that losing weight is impossible once gained suggests that they may be underestimating the human capacity for change and adaptation. Rather than viewing bulking as a path to obesity, it is more accurate to see it as a strategy for building strength, improving overall health, and developing a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between diet, lifestyle, and body composition."
t3_ew4z64,"Student loan forgiveness is the hot new way to say 3 trillion bank bailout My view is simple, the biggest benefactor in any loan forgiveness plan is the banks. Money that may or may not be paid back over time are instantly recovered for the banks to be reinvested for their next big scheme. Forgiving student loans helps millions of Americans, lenders have taken advantage of a situation while working with colleges to drive tuition costs up like a rocket. Forgiving the loans currently out, is a short-sighted attempt to activate a base group of voters while simultaneously sucking off their bank friends. What does it do for making college affordable? What does it do for the millions that already paid off their loans or never took any? What does it do for people and families that have had to go without, because of monthly payments? What penalties do the banks face if their lending was predatory? For the record...I did not go to college, I sought professional licenses and Im doing alright, but I have two children that I want to be able to go to college if they want without spending half their working life paying for their education. My view will be changed if it could be explained how forgiving these few outstanding loans could be for the greater good.","While it is true that student loan forgiveness may seem like a handout to banks, it's essential to consider the broader context and the potential long-term benefits for the economy and society as a whole. Rather than viewing loan forgiveness as a bailout, it can be seen as an investment in the future of millions of Americans who are struggling to make ends meet while paying off their debts. By forgiving outstanding loans, the government can stimulate economic growth, as individuals will have more disposable income to spend on other goods and services, creating jobs and driving innovation. This, in turn, can lead to increased tax revenues for the government, which can be used to address other pressing issues, such as infrastructure development and education reform.

Furthermore, the argument that loan forgiveness does not address the root causes of rising tuition costs is not entirely accurate. In reality, many colleges and universities have been able to increase their prices due to a combination of factors, including reduced government funding, decreased state support, and increased administrative costs. By forgiving outstanding loans, the government can provide much-needed relief to students and families while also creating an opportunity to reform the higher education system and make it more affordable for future generations.

In addition, the notion that loan forgiveness benefits only a select group of voters is a short-sighted view. In reality, millions of Americans are affected by the student loan debt crisis, and forgiveness would provide a much-needed boost to their financial stability and well-being. This, in turn, can have a positive impact on the broader community, as individuals are more likely to invest in their local economies, start businesses, and participate in civic activities.

It is also worth noting that many banks and financial institutions have already written off significant amounts of student loan debt as bad debt, which can have a negative impact on their financial statements and investor confidence. By forgiving outstanding loans, the government can actually provide a benefit to the financial sector by reducing the risk of future defaults and allowing banks to redirect their resources towards more productive investments.

Ultimately, student loan forgiveness is not a simple solution, but it is a necessary step towards creating a more equitable and sustainable higher education system. By addressing the immediate needs of students and families, the government can create a foundation for long-term reform and innovation in the education sector, ultimately benefiting both individuals and society as a whole.","While the idea of forgiving student loans may seem like a handout to the banks, it is essential to consider the broader economic and social implications. Research has shown that every dollar spent on student loan forgiveness can have a multiplier effect, injecting money back into the local economy and creating jobs. This, in turn, can lead to increased economic growth and reduced poverty rates, ultimately benefiting society as a whole. Furthermore, the argument that forgiving loans would only benefit banks ignores the reality that many lenders have already written off or settled millions of dollars in bad loans. In fact, the largest student loan servicers, such as Navient and Sallie Mae, have a long history of predatory lending practices, including charging exorbitant interest rates and fees. By forgiving loans, the government can hold these lenders accountable for their actions and create a more level playing field for all borrowers. Moreover, student loan forgiveness can also address the root causes of financial burdens on students and families, including rising tuition costs and lack of financial literacy. Alternative education models, such as competency-based education and income-share agreements, have shown promising results in reducing costs and increasing accessibility. By exploring these innovative solutions, we can create a more equitable and sustainable education system that benefits not only students but also the economy as a whole. Additionally, student loan forgiveness can also help to reduce the wealth gap and promote social mobility, as those who have struggled to pay off their loans can now use the money they would have spent on debt to invest in their future and their communities. It is also worth noting that the 3 trillion figure cited in the original argument is a significant exaggeration, as many student loans will never be paid in full. A more realistic estimate suggests that forgiving outstanding loans would likely be a fraction of this amount. Ultimately, student loan forgiveness is not just a bailout for banks, but a critical investment in the future of our society, and one that can have long-term benefits for individuals, families, and the economy.","While the notion of student loan forgiveness may seem like a simplistic solution to alleviate the burden of debt for a select few, it is essential to consider the far-reaching consequences of this policy on the economy and society as a whole. From a biogeographical perspective, the distribution of student loan debt can be seen as a complex web of interconnected factors, including rising tuition costs, limited job opportunities, and a struggling middle class. By forgiving student loans, we are not merely helping a specific group of individuals; we are, in fact, addressing a broader issue of economic inequality and promoting a more stable and sustainable economic ecosystem. Just as the conservation of a specific species can have a ripple effect on the entire ecosystem, forgiving student loans can have a similar impact on the economy, leading to increased consumer spending, reduced income inequality, and a more robust economic growth.

Moreover, the notion that forgiving student loans benefits banks at the expense of taxpayers is a narrow view that overlooks the long-term benefits of a more educated and skilled workforce. A more educated population is better equipped to contribute to the economy, pay taxes, and drive innovation, ultimately benefiting society as a whole. Furthermore, the idea that forgiving student loans is a short-sighted attempt to activate a base group of voters is a cynical view that ignores the potential for this policy to have a lasting impact on the economy and society. In fact, studies have shown that every dollar invested in education generates a significant return in terms of economic growth and tax revenue.

It is also worth noting that the author's suggestion that people who have paid off their loans or never took any are somehow excluded from the benefits of student loan forgiveness is a misinterpretation of the issue. The reality is that student loan forgiveness is not a zero-sum game, where one group's gain comes at the expense of another. Rather, it is a policy that aims to address a systemic issue that affects millions of Americans, regardless of their individual circumstances. By forgiving student loans, we are not penalizing those who have worked hard to pay off their debts; we are, in fact, providing a safety net for those who have been left behind by the system.","The assertion that forgiving student loans is equivalent to a 3 trillion bank bailout oversimplifies the complex relationship between lenders, borrowers, and the economy. While it's true that banks initially benefit from loan forgiveness, this perspective neglects the broader impact on individuals, families, and society as a whole. For millions of Americans struggling with debt, loan forgiveness can be a lifeline, freeing up resources for other essential expenses like housing, healthcare, and food. Moreover, forgiving outstanding loans does not address the root causes of high tuition costs; rather, it provides immediate relief to those who are most in need. In contrast to the original argument, which implies that student loan forgiveness is solely a form of vote buying or special interest favoritism, research suggests that targeted support for borrowers can actually help alleviate systemic issues like predatory lending and skyrocketing college costs. Furthermore, loan forgiveness programs have shown promise in reducing income inequality and improving economic mobility. Rather than pitting students against lenders, policymakers should focus on developing more comprehensive solutions that benefit all parties involved. By doing so, the benefits of student loan forgiveness can be maximized while minimizing potential drawbacks.","The assumption that forgiving student loans would fail to address the underlying issues surrounding college affordability neglects the numerous studies demonstrating a strong correlation between loan debt and financial stress among young adults. For those who have already paid off their loans or never took on debt, it's essential to recognize that these individuals are not representative of the broader student population. In fact, research suggests that nearly 70 of students graduate with some form of debt, highlighting the pervasive nature of this issue. By providing targeted support for borrowers through loan forgiveness programs, policymakers can help alleviate the financial burden on students and their families, ultimately making higher education more accessible and affordable. Moreover, forgiveness initiatives can also encourage lenders to re-examine their business practices and offer more competitive interest rates or flexible repayment terms. As the original argument notes, forgiving outstanding loans does not necessarily address the root causes of high tuition costs; however, it can serve as an important step toward creating a more equitable and sustainable higher education system.","The claim that student loan forgiveness would primarily benefit banks ignores the complex dynamics at play in the lending industry. In reality, many lenders have already implemented measures to mitigate potential losses associated with loan forgiveness programs, such as adjusting interest rates or implementing income-driven repayment plans. Furthermore, the vast majority of outstanding loans are held by government-backed agencies like Sallie Mae and FedLoan Servicing, rather than private banks. By forgiving these debts, policymakers can help reduce the burden on taxpayers who ultimately foot the bill for defaulted loans. Rather than focusing solely on lender interests, a more nuanced approach would recognize the interconnected nature of the economy and the role that affordable education plays in driving economic growth and social mobility. By providing targeted support for borrowers through loan forgiveness programs, policymakers can create a virtuous cycle of investment in human capital, economic opportunity, and financial stability. In doing so, they can help ensure that all individuals  regardless of their background or financial circumstances  have access to the education and resources needed to succeed in an increasingly complex and competitive economy."
t3_8tvru0,"Drug addiction is a choice, not a disease I do have sympathy for those with drug addiction, but they did originally make the choice to put the drugs into there body. No one held them down and injected them with heroin. I understand that after that they cant fully control there needs, but it was there fault for doing the drugs in the first place. I try to have empathy for others whenever I can, but I find it difficult to do so for addicts when they are the architects of there own destruction. I would love to hear others viewpoints and experiences to better understand this complicated issue.","The idea that addiction is solely a matter of individual choice overlooks the intricate web of factors that contribute to its development. Research in psychology has consistently shown that addiction is a complex condition influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and social factors. For instance, studies have identified specific genetic markers that predispose individuals to addiction, while also highlighting the role of early life experiences, such as childhood trauma, in increasing the risk of developing addictive behaviors. Furthermore, societal pressures, such as peer influence and cultural norms, can also play a significant role in shaping an individual's decision to use substances.

Moreover, the assumption that individuals with addiction ""could have chosen not to"" use substances ignores the fact that addiction often involves a loss of control, rather than a voluntary choice. In the midst of addiction, individuals may experience intense cravings, withdrawal symptoms, and cognitive impairments that compromise their ability to make informed decisions. This is not to say that individuals with addiction are completely powerless, but rather that their agency is compromised by the condition itself.

In addition, the notion that addiction is simply a matter of individual responsibility fails to account for the many structural barriers that prevent individuals from accessing treatment and support services. For example, individuals from low-income backgrounds or those living in areas with limited access to healthcare may face significant obstacles in seeking help for their addiction. Similarly, individuals from marginalized communities may experience systemic racism and stigma that further exacerbate their struggles with addiction.

Ultimately, viewing addiction as solely a matter of individual choice oversimplifies a multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive and compassionate approach. By recognizing the interplay between biology, environment, and social factors, we can work towards a more nuanced understanding of addiction and develop more effective strategies for prevention, treatment, and recovery. This involves acknowledging the humanity and dignity of individuals with addiction, rather than pathologizing them or attributing blame.","The notion that addiction is solely a personal choice overlooks the intricate web of circumstances that often lead individuals down the path of substance abuse. In reality, addiction is a complex condition that can be triggered by a multitude of factors, including genetics, trauma, and environmental influences. For instance, a person growing up in an impoverished neighborhood with limited access to resources and opportunities may be more susceptible to addiction as a coping mechanism. Similarly, individuals with mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety may turn to substances as a means of self-medication. By ignoring these underlying factors, we risk stigmatizing those who are struggling and failing to provide them with the support they need to recover.

Moreover, addiction is not simply a matter of personal responsibility, but rather a chronic disease that affects individuals from all walks of life. Studies have shown that addiction is a treatable condition, but one that requires a comprehensive approach that includes medical treatment, counseling, and community support. By investing in addiction treatment and prevention programs, we can reduce the economic burden of addiction on communities and improve overall public health. In fact, every dollar invested in addiction treatment yields a return of up to 4 in reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity. By recognizing addiction as a public health issue rather than a moral failing, we can work towards creating a more compassionate and effective approach to addressing this complex problem.","The notion that drug addiction is a personal choice, rather than a disease, oversimplifies the complex interplay of factors that contribute to this multifaceted issue. Research in neuroscience and psychology has shown that addiction is a chronic brain disease characterized by changes in brain structure and function, particularly in regions involved in reward, motivation, and memory. These changes are a result of the repeated use of substances, which can lead to long-term adaptations that alter an individual's response to substances and their environment. The idea that individuals can simply ""choose"" to stop using drugs ignores the fact that addiction can be a compulsive behavior, driven by factors beyond an individual's conscious control.

Moreover, societal factors play a significant role in shaping an individual's likelihood of developing an addiction. The glamorization of substance use in popular culture, as seen in movies and television shows, can normalize and even romanticize the use of drugs, making them seem appealing and accessible to those who may be vulnerable to their effects. The social pressures to conform to certain peer groups or lifestyles can also contribute to the development of addiction, particularly in individuals who are already experiencing stress, anxiety, or other mental health issues. Systemic inequalities, such as poverty, lack of access to education and healthcare, and exposure to trauma, can also increase an individual's likelihood of developing an addiction.

Furthermore, the notion that addiction is a matter of personal choice neglects the role of trauma and stress in contributing to the development of addiction. Individuals who have experienced trauma, such as childhood abuse or neglect, are more likely to develop addiction as a coping mechanism for their emotional pain. The brain's response to stress can also play a role in addiction, as the release of stress hormones like cortisol can increase the motivation to engage in substance use as a way to self-medicate. By ignoring these complex factors, the idea that addiction is a personal choice does a disservice to individuals struggling with addiction, implying that they are solely responsible for their situation and neglecting the need for compassionate support and treatment.","The argument that individuals with drug addiction are fully responsible for their choices ignores the pervasive influence of societal factors on addictive behavior. Structural inequalities, such as limited access to healthcare, education, or job opportunities, can create an environment where people feel forced to rely on substances as a means of coping with stress and adversity. Additionally, the proliferation of big pharma's marketing campaigns and the normalization of substance use in popular culture contribute to the widespread availability and glorification of addictive substances. It is essential to recognize that addiction is not solely a personal issue but also a symptom of broader societal problems that require collective action and responsibility.","The idea that individuals with drug addiction are responsible for their choices neglects the critical role of neurobiology in the development of addiction. The release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward, plays a significant part in the formation of addictive behaviors. However, repeated exposure to substances can lead to long-term changes in brain chemistry, effectively hijacking the natural reward system and reducing the ability to experience pleasure without substance use. These neural adaptations can render individuals unable to control their behavior, making it difficult for them to abstain from substance use despite a desire to do so. By acknowledging the neural basis of addiction, we can work towards more effective treatment strategies that address the root causes of this complex condition rather than simply blaming individuals for their choices.","The notion that drug addiction is a choice rather than a disease oversimplifies the complexities of this multifaceted issue. Research has consistently shown that drug addiction is characterized by changes in brain chemistry, structure, and function, which can occur after repeated exposure to substances. These alterations can lead to impaired cognitive control, emotional regulation, and decision-making abilities, rendering it increasingly difficult for individuals to resist the temptation of drugs. Furthermore, the concept of choice implies a level of agency that is often absent in situations where addiction has taken hold. In reality, many people become addicted as a result of circumstances such as trauma, poverty, or social isolation, which can make them more vulnerable to substance abuse. It is essential to acknowledge that addiction is not simply a matter of personal failure but rather a condition that demands compassion and understanding."
t3_xuu099,"YouTube is doing all they can Every couple of weeks, some creator blows up with a horror story of how their channel was deleted for no reason, how the algorithm is racist, how their content was claimed by bad actors, etc. These are obviously issues with underlying causes, but the call always falls to YouTube to fix their platform. I'm here to say, it's not feasibly possible for YouTube to fix their platform. There are millions of YEARS worth of continuous video on YouTube. 500 hours of content are uploaded every minute. People are being absolutely delusional if they assume humans are manually dealing with any of that data on the backend in any but the most extreme circumstances. Realistically, 99.9999... of the process is automated. And there are no other solutions unless you want to hook the entire population of Norway up to Clockwork Orange rigs for a few years. Does the system give false positives and remove innocent videos? Yes. But it's hard to argue for innocent until proven guilty when bad actors try to teach toddlers to kill themselves

Does the algorithm bias against certain demographics? Almost certainly. But that's not a secret racist cabal of YouTube Execs deciding that. It's machine learning. If the algorithm learns to be racist, it's because the viewers were consciously or unconsciously biased towards those results. So why doesn't YouTube just ""fix"" the algorithm and the bots? Well, interestingly, it's because machine learning has outpaced human understanding. There is no nerd squad that can just open up the hood and turn off the racism line of code. Modern bots are made using the Monkeys with Typewiters method. Yes, YouTube has a lot of problems, but those problems are largely societal. And honestly, until Skynet comes out, I think it would be easier to fix society than try to reign in an ocean of data by yelling at it.","The argument that YouTube's problems are solely a result of societal issues and cannot be fixed by the platform itself is an oversimplification that neglects the critical role that technology plays in shaping these problems. While it is true that machine learning algorithms are inherently biased and that societal issues contribute to this bias, it is disingenuous to suggest that YouTube bears no responsibility for the impact of its platform. The platform's algorithms, for instance, are designed to prioritize content that is likely to engage users, which often leads to the amplification of sensational and divisive content. This can have serious consequences, including the spread of misinformation and the radicalization of certain groups.

Furthermore, the idea that machine learning has outpaced human understanding is not a justification for inaction, but rather a call to arms for more research and development in the field. Modern machine learning systems are not invincible and can be designed with fairness and accountability in mind. For instance, techniques such as debiasing and regularized learning can be employed to mitigate the effects of bias in machine learning models. Moreover, YouTube can work with researchers and policymakers to develop and implement more effective content moderation strategies that balance the need to protect free speech with the need to prevent the spread of harmful content.

The notion that YouTube's content is too vast to be manually reviewed is a valid concern, but it is not a reason to abandon efforts to improve the platform's algorithms and moderation policies. In fact, many content creators and researchers are already working on developing AI-powered tools to help detect and remove harmful content. These tools can be trained on large datasets and can be designed to be more effective than manual review processes. Additionally, YouTube can also invest in human review teams that can focus on the most sensitive and high-stakes content, such as hate speech and child exploitation.

Ultimately, the relationship between technology and society is complex and multifaceted, and it is not accurate to reduce YouTube's problems to a simple dichotomy of societal issues versus technological limitations. By acknowledging the interplay between these factors and working towards a more nuanced understanding of the problem, we can develop more effective solutions that prioritize the well-being of both creators and users.","While it's true that YouTube's algorithm is a complex system, it's not a fixed entity that cannot be altered or improved. The notion that the algorithm's biases are solely a product of machine learning, rather than human design or lack thereof, is a convenient excuse for inaction. The fact that the algorithm is largely automated does not absolve YouTube of its responsibility to ensure fairness and equity in its content moderation. In fact, the vast scale of the platform's data only underscores the need for more robust safeguards against bias and abuse.

Furthermore, the comparison to societal problems is a red herring. While it's true that societal issues contribute to the complexity of the problem, it's precisely the role of technology companies like YouTube to develop solutions that mitigate these issues, rather than simply pointing to them as an excuse for inaction. The argument that YouTube's algorithm is too complex to be ""fixed"" by a nerd squad is a defeatist attitude that ignores the ingenuity and creativity of the tech community. In fact, many successful projects have demonstrated that large-scale data analysis and machine learning can be harnessed to improve content moderation and detection of bias.

Moreover, the notion that YouTube's algorithm is akin to a ""Skynet"" that cannot be tamed is a caricature that oversimplifies the complexity of AI systems. While it's true that machine learning has outpaced human understanding in some respects, this is precisely the area where more research and investment are needed to develop more accountable and transparent AI systems. Rather than throwing up our hands and saying that nothing can be done, we should be demanding that tech companies like YouTube take a more proactive approach to addressing the problems that their algorithms create. By investing in more robust testing, data analysis, and human oversight, YouTube can develop a more equitable and fair content moderation system that benefits creators and users alike.","While it's true that the sheer volume of content on YouTube presents significant challenges for content moderation, it's disingenuous to suggest that the platform is absolved of responsibility for the harm caused by its automated systems. The fact that AI-driven moderation can be flawed and biased does not negate the need for robust human oversight and accountability. In the entertainment industry, where performances are carefully curated and reviewed by human professionals, we understand that even with the best intentions, mistakes can still occur. However, this does not preclude the need for human intervention and curation. In fact, the stakes are often even higher in the context of online content, where a single misstep can have far-reaching and devastating consequences. Moreover, it's not just a matter of scaling up human review teams to match the volume of content; it's about implementing systems that prioritize nuance and context. For instance, AI-driven moderation might flag a video as violating community guidelines, but a human reviewer could then carefully examine the context, taking into account factors like intent, cultural sensitivity, and the potential impact on marginalized communities. This approach would not only prevent false positives but also foster a more inclusive and empathetic online environment. Rather than dismissing the issue as a societal problem that cannot be addressed, we should recognize that YouTube's responsibility is not solely tied to its technology but also to its role as a platform that has a profound impact on its users. By acknowledging this responsibility and working towards a more balanced approach that combines AI and human oversight, YouTube can create a safer and more equitable online space for all users.","The argument that YouTube's platform is too vast for human moderators to handle and therefore, false positives are inevitable, overlooks the fact that the issue isn't just about the scale of the problem but also how it's being addressed. The existence of automated moderation tools doesn't necessarily mean that humans are off the hook entirely. In fact, many companies have successfully implemented hybrid models that combine AI with human oversight to improve content moderation. This approach could be applied to YouTube as well, enabling them to manually review and correct mistakes made by their algorithms while still leveraging automation for efficiency.

Moreover, arguing that machine learning is a reflection of societal biases rather than a problem in itself can be seen as a form of technologically-assisted moral relativism. By absolving the platform from responsibility, we might inadvertently allow harmful content to proliferate under the guise of ""machine learning"" gone wrong. This kind of thinking also neglects the possibility that YouTube could proactively take steps to address these biases through targeted training data and more inclusive moderation practices.

In contrast, recognizing the need for active intervention in how algorithms learn and are trained can help mitigate some of the societal problems being alluded to. Rather than relying on a binary approach where society is either fixed or left as is, it's possible to think about YouTube as part of the solution rather than an inevitable byproduct of societal ills.","The argument's focus on the technical feasibility of human moderators versus automated systems overlooks the crucial issue of user trust and safety within online platforms. The reliance on automation raises questions about accountability and transparency when issues arise with content removal or algorithmic bias. By framing these problems as inevitable byproducts of scale, we risk perpetuating a cycle where users are expected to accept imperfect moderation in lieu of better-designed systems.

This perspective neglects the importance of user-centric approaches that prioritize transparency, explainability, and accountability in content moderation processes. Implementing more robust mechanisms for appealing content removal decisions or providing clearer insights into how algorithms work could help rebuild trust with creators and users alike. Moreover, by acknowledging the limitations of current solutions and engaging with the broader community about what constitutes effective content moderation, YouTube can foster an environment where all stakeholders feel invested in creating a safer and more inclusive platform.

In doing so, we might find that addressing societal problems isn't necessarily at odds with improving content moderation but rather is deeply intertwined with it. By reorienting our discussion towards these interrelated issues, we can work towards solutions that not only acknowledge the complexity of the problem but also empower users to play a more active role in shaping online discourse.","The original argument places undue emphasis on the technical limitations of handling vast amounts of data while downplaying the critical role that platform policies and user engagement play in content moderation. By framing the issue solely as one of scalability, the discussion neglects the importance of nuanced policy-making and community-driven approaches to addressing harmful content.

For instance, if YouTube were to adopt a more proactive stance on policy development, incorporating feedback from creators, researchers, and users alike, it could lead to more effective solutions that account for both the complexity of human behavior and the dynamics of online communities. This collaborative approach would not only provide a more comprehensive framework for dealing with problematic content but also help foster a culture where creators feel invested in maintaining standards of decency and respect.

Furthermore, pointing out societal problems as the root cause of YouTube's issues can be seen as shifting blame away from the platform itself. While it is true that societal biases are reflected in machine learning, this doesn't absolve YouTube of responsibility for creating an environment that exacerbates these problems. By acknowledging their role in shaping the online discourse and working towards more inclusive policies and practices, YouTube could not only improve content moderation but also contribute to a broader cultural shift."
